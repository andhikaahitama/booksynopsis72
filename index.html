The book covers the period of World War II, The Cold War, and Vietnam--more than thirty-years of rich history from 1940 through 1970. <p>In "War Stories," there are 325 accounts from WWII veterans. In them, they describe their early training as they prepared for a war that they knew was coming, but had no name for. In great detail they portray the bloody assault on Utah Beach, on D-Day, June 6, 1944 and their subsequent fight through the hedgerows of Normandy. </p><p>They were the first division to enter Paris, and they rightfully lay claim to the honor of liberating that famous city. </p><p>They were the first division to breach the "impenetrable" Siegfired line and assure the destruction of Hitler's war machine. From there, they slugged their way through one of the bloodiest battles of the war in the Hurtgen Forest, going on to distinguish themselves again in Luxembourg and the Battle of the Bulge. Their stories are firsthand accounts of the conduct of that war and they conclude with stories from the home front, and their occupation period in the aftermath of WWII. </p><p>In the 1950s, the 4th Infantry Division faced the Russion threat along the borders of Europe and their tales authenticate the dangers of that period. </p><p>Again, in Vietnam, the 4th Infantry Division served with distinction and the stories of these Vietnam veterans redefine the word, "sacrifice." </p><p>In all 450 stories, a most complelling fact overcomes the reader: This is real history as only the men who fought the battles can describe and authenticate. No textbook, no narrative history can tell it like the men of the 4th Infantry Division. This book is destined to become a source for scholarly research and a book for the shear reading pleasure by those who love soldiers and their "War Stories."</p></p><p>As the president of the 22nd Infantry Regiment Society and the editor of their newsletter, I amassed a treasure trove of individual stories from the veterans of the 4th Infantry Division.(The 22nd Infantry Regiment is a part of the 4th Infantry Division.) I would cajole, beg and even browbeat them for articles for the newsletter and over the years my files became chock full of wonderful stories about World War II, The Cold War, and Vietnam. They were so good, so descriptive, I felt an obligation to publish them. <p>At each gathering of soldiers such as reunions, dedications, Memorial Day ceremonies, etc., I'd plead with 4th Infantry Division veterans to send me their stories and I promised them that someday they would be published. The result is this book, "War Stories, Utah Beach to Pleiku." </p><p>With the financial help of the National 4th Infantry Division Association, and the moral support of my family, my many friends and colleagues, we were able to publish these superbly written individual histories. "War Stories," is a "not for profit book." All profits are returned to the treasury of the National 4th Infantry Division Association. </p><p>Getting this book into print has been a labor of love. Our WWII veterans are passing from the scene at an alarming rate and I felt it was urgent that their history be told now. I am honored to be able to bring these war stories to the public. Read this book; learn about the steadfast loyalty of the 4th Infantry Division and their contributions to freedom around the world. Bob Babcock</p>Robert (Bob) O.

This thought-provoking and wide-ranging collection of essays examines the undiminished incandescence of Marilyn Monroe -- the impact she has had on our culture, the evolution of her legend since her death, and what she tells us now about our lives and times -- and includes previously unpublished work from some of America's best writers, such as: Joyce Carol Oates, Alice Elliot Dark, Albert Mobilo, Marge Piercy, Lore Segal, Lisa Shea, and many more. <br> From her troubled family beginnings to the infamous $13 million auction held at Christie's in New York City, <i>All the Available Light</i> paints an unforgettable portrait of Marilyn as you've never seen her before. <br> This extremely rare cover photo was taken c. 1954, on the set of <i>The Seven Year Itch.</i></p><p>Yona Zeldis McDonough is the author of seven novels. Her short fiction, articles, and essays have been published in anthologies as well as in numerous national magazines and newspapers. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>Picture the following scenario if you can: A woman, now approaching eighty, is seated with her husband in the audience of the City Center of Music and Drama one evening in the late 1950s. They are waiting for the curtain to go up on a performance of the New York City Ballet. It must have been an electric moment. Here is a young and yet world-class ballet company whose founder and main choreographer -- brilliant Russian-born George Balanchine -- is in his prime. The theater itself, built in 1924 by the Ancient and Accepted Order of the Mystic Shrine, is wonderfully antic and absurd, with fanciful tiles in bright colors studding the outlandish surfaces of its architecture.<br><br>What were they going to see that night? <i>Allegro Brillante? Agon? Stars and Stripes? A Midsummer Night's Dream?</i> And who might have been dancing? Allegra Kent? Violette Verdy? Maria Tallchief? Melissa Hayden? It almost doesn't matter; it was sure to have been a spectacular night. But as the woman sat there, reading her program notes and chatting idly with her husband, she began to sense a kind of hum in the crowd, a certain energy that seemed to gather and swell, despite the fact that the curtain remained motionless and the lights had not yet begun to dim.<br><br>What could it be? She and her husband looked at each other, puzzled. Then they began to look around. There, in a balcony below, sat Marilyn Monroe and her then husband, Arthur Miller. The intensity of the excitement continued to grow as more and more people began first to whisper and then intone, "Marilyn, Marilyn." Sporadic clapping began; quickly it turned into an ovation, with people on their feet shouting out her name. One can only imagine how the dancers must have felt as they pawed the ground with their pointe shoes, as they always do before a performance, and did a few nervous relev�s backstage. The giddy applause, the wild, joyful adulation rightfully belonged to them on that night: who could have stolen it? I'm sure that at some point they learned the answer and had to go on with the performance anyway, despite the fact that it must have been something of a letdown. For Marilyn, being Marilyn, did what she always seemed to do: she absorbed all the available light and made it her own.<br><br>When she was there -- on screen, or in person -- it became almost impossible to pay attention to anyone else. And maybe that, more than anything, was her special gift: the riveting of the collective attention to one face, one form, one voice, as it smiled and moved and utterly transformed everything around it.<br><br>I was too young to have known or appreciated the phenomenon that was Marilyn Monroe firsthand: I was five years old when she died on that August morning in 1962. But I can remember quite vividly the first televised image I saw of her: a clip of the now-famous rendition of "Happy Birthday" she sang for President John F. Kennedy. She wore a sparkling, beaded gown that seemed quite transparent, and beneath it, little or perhaps even nothing else. The spotlight quivered and dipped but was essentially confined to her radiant face; it never moved below, so that her nearly naked breasts and body remained in a kind of tantalizing shadow. Who would not be tantalized by her performance, this beautiful woman with the little-girl voice who embodied so many different kinds of resonant and unsettling paradoxes?<br><br>The facts of her life are, at this point, familiar signposts in the well-rehearsed legend. Born to Gladys Pearl Baker in Los Angeles on June 1, 1926, the name on her birth certificate is Norma Jean. Her father is nowhere in sight and her mother is soon diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. After a brief stint in an orphanage, little Norma Jean is bounced around from foster home to foster home. She marries a local neighbor boy at sixteen, embarks on a modeling career, and is soon discovered by a Hollywood movie executive. The husband is discarded, like so much else in her earlier life. In 1947, at the age of twenty-one, she appeared in her first motion picture; by 1950, her roles in such films as <i>Asphalt Jungle</i> and <i>All About Eve</i> begin to command attention. There are more films, of course, and eventually she achieves starring roles in them: <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, How to Marry a Millionaire, The Seven-Year Itch, Bus Stop, Some Like It Hot.</i> There are well-publicized marriages, to ballplayer Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller, and equally well-publicized divorces. And there are affairs, lots of them, with other movie stars, like Yves Montand, or with politicians, like the Kennedys. There are nervous breakdowns, bouts of depression, miscarriages, and suicide attempts. Finally, there is the drug overdose -- intentional? accidental? -- and on August 5, 1962, Marilyn's lovely light went out forever.<br><br>But in fact, this is hardly what happened. If anything, the legend that is Marilyn Monroe has even surpassed the life. For one thing, there are the films, and film grants a kind of immortality in the face of all the evidence to the contrary. Even though we may know, intellectually, that Marilyn Monroe died by her own hand from an overdose of barbiturates, when her violet-satin-clad body -- seen in a series of mirrors -- spans the screen five times over in <i>How to Marry a Millionaire,</i> or when her creamy, abundant flesh pours, once more, from the low-cut black negligee she wears in <i>Some Like it Hot,</i> she is with us still; she lives.<br><br>Hollywood has had its share of icons and sacrifices before and after her: James Dean, Carol Lombard, Jayne Mansfield, all had tragic and untimely deaths. But more than any other, Marilyn's is the story that continues to weave itself around our collective consciousness, Forty years later, she continues to captivate and compel, offering some elusive glimpse -- perhaps it is a mirror, perhaps a window -- into the soul of the life and times that traipsed on without her.<br><br>The essays in this book attempt to come to grips with her ongoing power to fascinate, to entrance, and to inspire. Some are taken from already existing material, for Marilyn's life and death prompted responses and analyses from any number of notable writers. Others were commissioned expressly for this volume and address what has happened in the forty years since she walked among us, the gap, as it were, between the reality -- which of course we will never know -- and the fantasy that has assumed an intricate and engaging pattern all its own. Marilyn -- both the woman and the myth -- remains at the center of it all.<br><br>Introduction, <i>Reliquary,</i> essay introductions, and essay compilation copyright � 2002 by Yona Zeldis McDonough</p><h2>Flight of the Dragonfly</h2><p>The first manned mission to another star brings the discovery of alien intelligences and a new world</p><p></p><h2>Magic Beach: A Special 20th Anniversary Edition</h2><p><b>A special hardcover&nbsp;edition of a beloved beach book, featuring a pull-out frieze to pin up</b><b></b>&nbsp;Filled with fun rhymes and make-believe stories, this wonderfully illustrated children's tale offers an imaginative view of a beach that includes swimming, surfing, and splashing.

GREELEY, a Catholic priest and sociologist, is an Honorary Senior Fellow at the University of Ireland in Dublin.The leisurely, enjoyable sequel to Greeley's A Midwinter's Tale again follows the O'Malley family of Chicago. Here he chronicles the romantic and spiritual fortunes of returned soldier Chuck O'Malley, who comes home in 1949, having been stationed for two years in postwar Germany. Enrolling in Notre Dame, he finds himself chafing against the narrow intellectual limits of the curriculum, and he also struggles mightily, even self-mockingly, with the sin of lust. The conversational, reflective first-person narration sets a relaxed tone as Chuck, admiring the two-piece bathing suits newly in vogue, develops a passion for photography. The central image, bookending the novel, is a snapshot Chuck takes of beautiful Rosemarie Clancy, the troubled alcoholic daughter of Chuck's father's best friend. The photo of Rosemarie, in d?shabill?, gets Chuck into trouble at Notre Dame and concatenates his search for spiritual meaning within the strict prohibitions of the Church. Chuck and Rosemarie's lifelong mutual attraction permeates the novel, with Greeley shifting focus in the middle of the book to Chuck's father, John. The elder O'Malley tells of how he met Chuck's mother, and the part Rosemarie's father, Jim Clancy, played in the eventual union. John O'Malley's story is deftly set in the center of Chuck's saga, creating correlative resonances that would be less graceful and harmonious in a single plot line. Greeley conveys a palpable nostalgia, as if each story of love won and lost is simply the latest echo of an earlier story, itself the echo of another. He captures, with signature expertise, both the essence (torturous guilt over sexual longings and transgressions) and the evocative details (students forbidden to read Ulysses, descriptions of women's fortresslike undergarments) of growing up Catholic in the late '40s. By the end, where Greeley skillfully ties up one plot line as he keeps the other aloft for the next book, readers may discover that they, too have been romancedAby an expert storyteller. $100,000 ad/promo.

So begins the most logical silliness to be found anywhere--at least since Laura Joffe Numeroff and illustrator Felicia Bond's <i>If You Give a Mouse a Cookie</i>. Readers will follow a young boy and his voracious visitor through a series of antlered antics: jam reveries and puppet shows and big messes. It all makes perfect sense, really, once you stop to think about it. What moose <i>wouldn't</i> want to borrow a sweater when it's cold outside? And why shouldn't the loose button on the sweater remind him of his grandmother? Bond's cleverly detailed, witty illustrations perfectly complement Numeroff's deadpan style. Through just a few deft words and brush strokes, the reader gets a real sense of the unique personalities of the two characters. Children will relate easily to the full-circle reasoning of the story, while picking up the concept of cause and effect. The moral of the story? Keep plenty of muffin mix and blackberry jam in your cupboard. You never know <i>who</i> may drop by.

Bruce Knecht, former reporter for <i>The</i> <i>Wall Street Journal</i>and author of <i>The Proving Ground</i> and <i>Hooked</i>, describes the creation of an outsized yacht in a sweeping narrative centered on the men and women who made it happen.</b><br><br>Doug Von Allmen, a self-made man who grew up in a landlocked state dreaming of the ocean, was poised to build a 187-foot yacht that would cost $40 million. <i>Lady Linda </i>would not be among the very largest of the burgeoning fleet of oceangoing palaces, but Von Allmen vowed that it would be the best one ever made in the United States. Nothing would be ordinary. The interior walls would be made from rare species of burl wood, the floors paved with onyx and exotic types of marble, the furniture custom made, and the art specially commissioned. <br> <br>But the 2008 economic crisis changed everything. Von Allmen&#x2019;s lifestyle suddenly became unaffordable. Then it got worse: desperate to reverse his losses, he fell for an audacious Ponzi scheme. Would Von Allmen be able to complete <i>Lady Linda</i>? Would the shipyard and its one thousand employees survive the financial meltdown? <br> <br>The divide between the very rich and everyone else had never been greater, yet the livelihoods of the workers, some of them illegal immigrants, and the yacht owners were inextricably intertwined. In a sweeping, high-stakes narrative, the critically acclaimed author of <i>The Proving Ground </i>and <i>Hooked </i>weaves Von Allmen&#x2019;s story together with those of the men and women who are building his yacht. As the pursuit of opulence collides with the reality of economic decline, everyone involved in the massive project is forced to rethink the meaning of the American Dream.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with G. Bruce Knecht</b></p> <p><strong>Q. Where did you get the idea for Grand Ambition?</strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong> This is my third book and the sad truth is that none of them resulted from my own ideas. <i>The Proving Ground</i>, the first one, was about the tragic 1998 Sydney to Hobart sailing race. That was my agent's idea. That book was a #1 bestseller in Australia and my publisher there had the idea for my second book--<i>Hooked: Pirates, Poaching and the Perfect Fish</i>. My German publisher came up with the idea for <i>Grand Ambition</i>. He talked about House, Tracy Kidder's book about the building of a small house. The concept was that if the building of simple wood-frame home could be turned into a very successful book that the creation of a large, technologically complicated and expensive yacht would lead to an even more compelling narrative. I agreed.</p> <p><strong>Q. Did you always plan on writing about the blue-collar laborers who built the yacht as well as its owner? </strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> Absolutely. I did not want to the focus to be on Doug Von Allmen, the owner, or the lifestyles of the very wealthy. Nor did I want the book to be a social commentary about income inequality or illegal immigration (some of the guys who worked on the boat were undocumented workers). What I wanted to do was to describe the lives and work of some of the hundreds of people&#x2014;ship-fitters, welders, plumbers and cabinetmakers--who came together to build a 187-foot, $40 million vessel.</p> <p><strong>Q. How did Gale Tribble end up becoming such a major character? </strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> The Von Allmens yacht was built in Gulfport, Mississippi. It's a part of the world that's full of colorful characters. Gale was one of the first people I met at the shipyard. He had spent 40 of his 59 years working as a ship-fitter and he was the guy who put together the very first pieces of the hull. I liked Gale from the moment I met him and he invited me to his home for after-work afternoon beers and conversation. His life could not be more different from the Von Allmens--or mine--and he had a great story to tell.</p> <p><strong>Q. How did Doug Von Allmen make his fortune?</strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> He came from a family that never had enough money. He was so physically frail that his mother didn't expect him to survive childhood, but he ended up becoming one of the early pioneers of what we now call private equity. He bought 52 companies and sold every one of them for more than he paid for them. They were small companies when he bought them, but he turned some of them into very substantial operations.</p> <p><strong>Q. Did you start working on the book before the financial crisis in 2008?</strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> Yes. I left the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, where I had been a reporter for many years, to start following the design and building process in 2007. It was a time of seemingly unstoppable economic growth and a time when shipyards couldn't begin to keep up with the demand for extraordinarily large yachts.</p> <p><strong>Q. So that means you started working on the book not knowing that Von Allmen would lose $100 million to a Ponzi scheme?</strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> That's right. Doug, by the way, was an unlikely victim. Before he was a private equity investor, he was an accountant with Peat Marwick. But Scott Rothstein--the guy who created the Ponzi--was diabolically clever. In retrospect, the tales he spun out to Von Allmen might seem incredible; but when you read my description of how Rothstein worked, I think you'll see how even a very experienced investor could fall victim.</p> <p><strong>Q. Did Von Allmen have any particular goals for his yacht?</strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> He had owned several yachts before. When he and his wife Linda--their yacht would be called <i>Lady Linda</i>--started planning this one, their goal was to create the best yacht ever made in the United States. Most people believe the best yachts are made in Europe. The Von Allmens wanted to prove them wrong.</p> <p><strong>Q. Did you always plan to include history about very large yachts? </strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> The richest members of societies going back to the Pharaohs have been building yachts. I didn't include a lot of history--I didn't want to slow down the narrative--but I did want to include stories about some of history's most colorful yacht owners: Cleopatra, European kings and queens, Chinese emperors, Greek shipping magnates, oil rich Arabs and Russians as well as Americans such as J.P. Morgan, Malcolm Forbes, Henry Ford II, Paul Allen, and Larry Ellison.</p> <p><strong>Q. Are people like Gale Tribble and Osly Heinandez bitter that they devoted their days to doing back-breaking and sometimes dangerous work to build what's basically a plaything for a very rich man? </strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> Not at all. By the time <i>Lady Linda</i> was completed, Tribble's body was literally falling apart. Working in a shipyard takes a much greater toll than, say, sitting at a desk writing a book, but he couldn't afford to retire and he still loved his work. Osly Heinandez is a 21-year-old illegal immigrant from Honduras who did some of the most difficult work there was and the work damaged his lungs. But he and Tribble never expressed any bitterness. On the contrary, they were quick to say that they were grateful to have a job and that they were proud to work on <i>Lady Linda</i>.</p> <p><strong>Q. Did you enjoy writing the book?</strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> Totally. I loved the people I got to know and I enjoyed watching the process evolve from tentative sketches in a London design studio to a 487-ton yacht. The only part I didn't like was worry about whether <i>Lady Linda</i> actually would be completed. Given the financial crisis and the Ponzi scheme, there were times when it looked like it wouldn't happen and it ended up taking two years longer than it was supposed to. If <i>Lady Linda</i> didn't make it across the finish line, I'm not sure I would have had a book.</p><b>G.

But whether written by a literary heavyweight or a popular romance writer, the stories share a simplicity of narrative and rather dramatic tone. Typical of the more romantic tales are Catherine Cookson's "Miss Geraldine Parkington," about a spinster from a well-to-do English family who proposes marriage to her longtime gardener, and Pilcher's "Lalla," in which a plain girl relates how her beautiful older sister gave up a dashing fiance and modeling career to return to her childhood sweetheart. Updike's "A Constellation of Events," a housewife's account of the beginning of an affair, stands out for its author's familiar ability to shade and alter narrative with a telling glance, or through tone of voice. Unfortunately, despite the presence of other major writers (Daphne du Maurier, Guy de Maupassant, H.E. Bates, Colette), such subtlety and craftsmanship are rare in this volume, which proves satisfying without being challenging, interesting without being memorable. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.It is deliciously easy to be swept away by Colette's masterful storytelling, and she is just one of the writers featured in this collection. In "The Kepi," it is apparent almost from the outset that an emotional descent awaits the woman who has just taken her first lover--a much younger man. Her initially "blissful immolation" is destined to end in heartbreak. And in "The Nerdlecase" by Elizabeth Bowen, it is not difficult to determine the paternity of the child born to an unmarried seamstress. Once Miss Fox is ensconced in the rather threadbare country home of her genteel employers, they are in for a rude surprise when she unveils a picture of the little boy. An atmosphere of weariness pervades these stories. The predominant and unmistakable mood is love, but love followed too closely by abandonment. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>Jewelry Illustration</h2><p>With almost 1000 drawings, this comprehensive book leads students systematically through the development of forms rendered in perspective, starting with simple boxes and working up to curvilinear jewelry objects. Beyond teaching the ability to render forms clearly for clients, this instruction will hone the ability to think three dimensionally. This book was originally written in French and published in Quebec where the author teaches jewelry illustration. The English-language edition features a new layout and more durable cover, but otherwise retains every powerful image of the original.

Japan's modern revolution spanned the third-quarter of the nineteenth century; knowledge of this history is essential to understand how and why Japan evolved into the nation it is today.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Samurai Revolution</i> is divided into two books in one complete volume. Book I chronicles the series of tumultuous and bloody events between 1853 and 1868, collectively called the Meiji Restoration, the "dawn of modern Japan," when the shogun's government was overthrown and the Emperor was restored to his ancient seat of power. Book 2 covers the first turbulent decade of the restored monarchy in which the new Imperial government worked desperately to consolidate its power and introduce innovations that would put Japan on equal footing with Western powers that threatened to dominate it. The government clashed with disgruntled samurai who felt left behind amid the whirlwind of changes toward modernization. Highlighted is the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, a failed samurai-led uprising that brought the end of the samurai way of life. <br> &nbsp;<br> As the first comprehensive history and analysis in English examining all the key players in this epoch drama, <i>Samurai Revolution</i> is the result of over twenty-five years of research. Throughout the book the author quotes extensively from the journals, memoirs, histories, and letters of Katsu Kaishu, a prolific writer, founder of Japan's modern navy, and later supreme commander of the shogun's military, who earned the epithet "the shogun's last samurai." These original translations give an insider's view, which along with the grand historical narrative provide readers with an unparalleled insight into this most momentous period in Japanese history.</p><p>The best writers of Japanese history are, quite naturally, Japanese. Nearly all of them concentrate on the most important era in modern Japanese history: the final fifteen years of the Tokugawa Shogunate, from the arrival of Perry in the summer of 1853, which kicked off the revolution, to the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate in late 1867. Japanese writers call this era "Bakumatsu," literally "end of the shogunate." I describe it as "the samurai revolution at the dawn of modern Japan."&nbsp;<br><br>Japanese writers concentrate on the Bakumatsu not only because it is the beginning of modern Japan, but also because it is by far the most interesting and spellbinding era in Japanese history. In writing about the Bakumatsu they naturally focus on the most powerful and interesting personalities of the era. These include but are not limited to such household names as Katsu Kaishu, Sakamoto Ryoma, Takechi Hanpeita, Yamauchi Yodo, Saigo Takamori, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, Takasugi Shinsaku, Yoshida Shoin, Katsura Kogoro, Ii Naosuke, Sakuma Shozan, Yamaoka Tesshu, and the Shinsengumi, an organization whose leaders, Kondo Isami and Hijikata Toshizo, garner significant attention. Readers of&nbsp;<i>Samurai Revolution</i> become familiar with all of these personalities and more.<br><br>When I started studying this history in the mid-1980s, I was living in Tokyo. At first I read everything I could get my hands on about the Bakumatsu. It didn't take long before I discovered that there was a gaping dearth of material in English about it. So I naturally focused on primary sources and secondary sources by Japanese writers. After a few years of reading I was able to discern the best among the Japanese writers of Bakumatsu history. I adopted their approach to writing this history, including their focus on the most powerful and spellbinding personalities. These Japanese writers are my teachers. My debt to them is enormous.&nbsp;<br><br>My most important primary sources include the journals, histories and oral memoirs (interviews) of Katsu Kaishu ("the Shogun's Last Samurai" of <i>Samurai Revolution</i>); the letters and other writings of Sakamoto Ryoma; the letters and "Kyoto Journal" of Takechi Hanpeita; the letters and other writings of Nakaoka Shintaro; and the oral memoirs (interviews) of Tokugawa Yoshinobu. My most important "teachers" include Hirao Michio, Shimozawa Kan, Kaionji Chogoro, Miyaji Saichiro, Matsuura Rei, Shiba Ryotaro, Matsuoka Mamoru, Furukawa Kaoru, Matsumoto Kenichi, Katsube Mitake, Ishii Takashi, and Konishi Shiro. Read about them in my "Samurai Revolution" blog at samurai-revolution.com.<br><br><i>Samurai Revolution</i> is the result of 25 years of research into this most important era in modern Japanese history.Romulus Hillsborough, originally from Los Angeles, lived in Tokyo for sixteen years, immersing himself in the study of Japanese language, history and culture. Most of his reading focused on major literary and historical works of Japan. He was particularly drawn in by the tumultuous history of the final years of the shogun's government and the return of political power to the Emperor.<br><br>To compliment his reading, the author traveled to historical cities and towns around Japan where his samurai subjects lived and died and where the revolution to overthrow the shogun unfolded. During that time he worked as a writer for a popular weekly magazine in Tokyo and later as a contributing journalist to a number of other Japanese publications.<br><br>Upon returning to the United States, Hillsborough settled in San Francisco.

Most of the articles in this volume were first published in 1988 as <i>Shapinsky's Karma, Boggs's Bills, and Other True-Life Tales</i> (the story of Boggs has been extracted and expanded into its own book); each of them profiles a creative individual who "works and works at something, which then happens of its own accord: it would not have happened without all the prior work, true, but its happening cannot be said to have resulted from all that work, the way effects are said to result from a series of causes." For republication, Weschler has provided updates on each of his subjects, from <i>Maus</i> creator Art Spiegelman to the now-deceased musical lexicographer Nicolas Slonimsky (whom Weschler profiled at the age of 92, and arguably at the peak of his career). He's also added two new "passion pieces," including a profile of comic artist Ben Katchor. <i>A Wanderer in the Perfect City</i> is as close to perfect as books get, and my advice to you is to get a copy, read it, and then reread it whenever your faith in literature needs restoring. If at all possible, get two copies, so you can share this graceful anthology yet never have to part with it.

Hopkins, a profound appreciator of life, suffered frequent bouts of melancholia and depression. Without benefit of worldy success for his poetry, the consolation of family life or the elation of fully investing his gifts, Hopkins remained hopeful, often cheerful and ever faithful to Christ. Hildegard, gifted with visions since childhood, recorded her wisdom, guiding readers through the mysteries of the Bible, the complexities of the moral life and the narrow gate into the kingdom. She became prophet, teacher, preacher and diplomat. Like Hopkins, she produced poetry and also music, medical and herbal guides, and scientific writings.</p><p></p><h2>LAST OF THE PIRATES: The Search for Bob Denard</h2><p>Provides a close-up look at the life and times of Bob Denard, an elusive French mercenary who plied his trade throughout Africa, following his career of intrigue, violence, and murder up to his 1989 disappearance. 17,500 first printing.</p><p>Samantha Weinberg was born in 1966 and studied Economics at Trinity College, Cambridge. She covered Namibian independence for the Daily Telegraph before spending two years working for the South African Weekly Mail in Johannesburg. She has contributed to the Spectator, Financial Times, Independent and the European and writes regularly on Africa for the Sunday Telegraph. This is her first book.Weinberg, a young British journalist with ties to South Africa, is intrigued with African politics. When she heard about French mercenary Bob Denard and his exploits on the tiny Comoros Islands, she vowed to travel there and track down the truth about his role in the overthrow of one president and the death of another. The Coromos, known for their ylang-ylang flowers, which are used in French perfumes, and for Mount Karthala, the world's largest active volcano, are home for approximately 480,000 Muslims of Arabic, Malayo-Polynesian, and African descent. Weinberg provides a thumbnail sketch of the islands' lively history as a center for maritime trade, magnet for pirates, and scene of European power struggles, a tradition that continued into the 1970s and 1980s. That's where Denard comes in. A mercenary who survived some very messy missions in Africa, Denard ended up in the Coromos, where his role in the assassination of President Abdallah is still debated. Weinberg is a bit of a novice, but she certainly knows how to tell a good story and sheds some light on the clandestine world of one slick soldier of fortune. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Yu-Gi-Oh!

(The New Revised Version): Join In The Joyful Awakening to the Supremacy of God&#39;s Son</h2><p>Christ Is ALL!<br> Join In the Joyful Awakening to the Supremacy of God&#x2019;s Son<br> David Bryant<br> condensed and updated with<br> Richard Ross<br> <br> Christ is ALL! (condensed and updated) is not a rehash of old Sunday School lessons on the life of Jesus. Quite the opposite. Christ Is ALL! (CIA) opens a new point of departure for your walk with God&#x2019;s Son. It explores nothing less than the full scope of His supremacy. It does so in anticipation of, and preparation for, something almost too wonderful to hope: a fresh work of God&#x2019;s Spirit among God&#x2019;s people to enlarge our vision of the reigning majesty of God&#x2019;s Son. The promise is poised ... impending ... bearing down upon us. It is a God-given "Christ-awakening", meant for the whole Church, in every part. <br> <br> The Subtitles Tell The Story<br> In 2003, New Providence Publishers (NPP) issued to wide acclaim David Bryant&#x2019;s Christ Is ALL! A Joyful Manifesto On The Supremacy of God&#x2019;s Son. Hardback, at nearly 470 pages, a Second Edition came out in 2005. Now, in 2010, NPP presents a "new revised version", a "reincarnation", as it were, of the original book in a 176 page paperback. Working with one of the nation&#x2019;s most respected trainers of youth workers, Dr. Richard Ross (professor at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Ft. Worth), David Bryant has condensed, remixed and updated his book. Originally written to train pastors and Christians leaders, this revised version specifically focuses its message on inspiring and equipping day-to-day Christians in every stream of the Church.<br> <br> Cutting out 300 pages, however, is not the most significant development in this process. The modified subtitle is! The original CIA was tagged "A Joyful Manifesto on the Supremacy of God&#x2019;s Son". But this revised CIA urges "Join the Joyful Awakening to the Supremacy of God&#x2019;s Son". Notice the shift? Frankly, its titanic. <br> <br> A decade ago, many parts of Christ&#x2019;s Body were sleeping through a major crisis, which Bryant called a "crisis of supremacy" (analyzed in chapters here, as well). To borrow Max Lucado&#x2019;s metaphor, too often Jesus was seen as a computer mouse, readily available to move the cursor across the screen to click-on whatever we needed next from God. I wrote my "manifesto" to help call the Church to re-engage with the active reign of Jesus&#x2013;to wake-up to who He really is as God&#x2019;s Son, where He&#x2019;s leading in God&#x2019;s purposes and what He&#x2019;s doing with God&#x2019;s people, as well as across our land and among the nations.<br> <br> But things are changing. Today this revised CIA invites readers to expect, prepare for and even experience something so joyous no Jesus-follower would dare be left behind. Many call it a Christ-awakening defined as "God&#x2019;s Spirit using God&#x2019;s Word to re-introduce God&#x2019;s people to God&#x2019;s Son for ALL He is".<br> <br> Editors for The Economist magazine recently authored God Is Back: How the Global Revival of Faith Is Changing the World. Similarly, this revised CIA might have been renamed: CHRIST IS BACK: The Awakening of the Church That Will Change the Nation and the World (and All of Us in the Process!).<br> <br> Except, of course... the Lord Jesus Christ is not "back". He never left! Christ is now. Ascended. Ruling. Redeeming. Triumphant. Moving sovereignly throughout His church. His reign is as undiminished in this hour as it will be the hour we stand before Him at the Climax, in the new heaven and earth. His irrevocable authority needs no re-instatement. Rather, it is many of us Christians who need restoration. It is the vision of our hearts that needs to replenished, re-conquered and re-commissioned in Him and for Him.<br> <br> More Than Meets The Eye: The CIA website<br> However, there&#x2019;s more to the new, revised version than one might guess simply looking its cover. Because, behind this slim volume is a website packed with free resources to help Christians implement much of what David Bryant calls for. For example, when readers visit www.ChristIsAllBook.com, they can download a four-week CIA devotional guide, or a CIA small group discussion guide, or an audio book taken from parts of CIA, or they can access expanded commentary on each chapter in the book&#x2013;and so much more. This dynamic interface between book and website offers a whole new opportunity for a life-changing reading experience. Also, orders can be placed there for major quantity discounts of the revised version, to encourage friends or even whole congregations. In addition, one can order a copy of the 470 page edition of Christ Is ALL!, still in print.<br> <br> Invitation<br> The past seven years, many national Christian leaders have urged David Bryant to adapt Christ Is ALL! for a wider Christian audience. That has now become reality. This new CIA is not so much a "manifesto" anymore. Rather, it&#x2019;s more like an "invitation". An invitation to enter into something worthy of our whole hearts. An invitation to join a Christ-awakening movement already underway. An invitation to start celebrating, as a way of life, nothing less than the supremacy of God&#x2019;s Son for all He is, for you and for me, for now and forever. An invitation for us to do this together.</p><p>Over the past 35 years, David Bryant has been defined by many as a "messenger of hope" and a "Christ-proclaimer" to the Church throughout the world. Formerly a pastor, minister-at-large with the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, president of Concerts of Prayer International (COPI) and chairman of America's National Prayer Committee, currently David provides leadership to PROCLAIM HOPE! whose mission is to "foster and serve a nationwide Christ-awakening movement". <br> <br> For decades David played a widely visible role in the emergence of an unprecedented, worldwide prayer movement by capitalizing on city-wide mass rallies; national and international conferences; training videos, seminars and manuals; development of leadership coalitions; the mentoring of younger leaders; and media outreach (both TV and radio). Many testify, however, that his key contribution has been and remains setting its most strategic agenda: a God-given awakening to the full extent of the supremacy of God's Son so as to revitalize Christians everywhere to serve His Kingdom purposes with renewed hope and passion. <br> <br> To that end, PROCLAIM HOPE! launched a NATIONAL CAMPAIGN OF HOPE, focused on a Christ-awakening throughout the churches of America. Along with a menu of training events such as "Christ Summits" and "Christ Colleges", foundational to helping Christians join and serve the campaign is David's recent, seminal 480-page book on Christ's supremacy titled CHRIST IS ALL! <br> <br> David and his wife Robyne were high school sweethearts in their hometown, Massillon, Ohio. They now call metropolitan New York/New Jersey their home. Their three grown children, Adam, Bethany and Benjamin, were adopted as infants from India.Endorsements for<br> Christ is ALL! The Revised Version<br> <br> Never has there been more urgency in our land for a God-given awakening to Christ. David Bryant&#x2019;s vision of Christ, and the full extent of His supremacy, can bring the Body of Christ together in powerfully transforming ways. We believe his message...(is) exactly what&#x2019;s needed at this critical moment in America. &#x2013; <br> <br> An Open Letter To The Church From 70 National Leaders, www.ProclaimHope.com<br> <br> Warning!

His book is a watershed treatise of what it means to have both a view of Christ and experience of Christ necessary to exercise consequential leadership in our generation."<br> Mac Pier, President,The NYC Leadership Center (NYCLeadership.com)<br> David Bryant has taught me a great deal but nothing as vital as the content of Christ Is ALL!. Unless we restore Christ's supremacy inside the church we will never have a message or mission for those outside the church. We keep looking for a program or technique to guide us but here is the real answer for what we truly need to find our way home--the recovery of Christ alone, the one who has all authority in heaven and on earth!<br> John Armstrong, President, ACT 3 (Act3online.com)<br> /////////////////////////////<br> <br> More than anyone else I know, David Bryant has a passion for Christ and a passion for a Christ-awakening throughout America, and for that matter the whole world. As the years have gone by, David&#x2019;s vision has become greater and clearer as by faith he has laid hold of God&#x2019;s promises of spiritual renewal. This book is a distillation of what David lives and breathes so passionately, namely the exaltation of Christ among the nations. The church needs to hear this clear call so that she can march forward with a confidence that is worthy of our triumphant Savior. Read this book in the quietness of your room and then spread its message from the mountaintops.<br> Dr. Erwin W. Lutzer, Senior Pastor, The Moody Church, Chicago <br> "After all we know of Jesus Christ and what He has done for us, you'd think we would all live in joyful submission to Him. But we know that is not the case. Christ is All has brought us a clear and compelling view of our Savior that can enliven our relationship with Him and, when shared with others, can powerfully unite the body of Christ in worshipping and serving Him. This new resource makes it even more understandable and usable. Please seriously consider it."<br> <br> Paul Fleischmann, President National Network of Youth Ministries (www.youthworkers.net)<br> <br> As a businessman, I've come to appreciate the power of focus, clarity and simplicity. David's first book "Christ is All" is consummately focused as it delves deeply into Apostle Paul's powerful Colossians' declaration. Now, The Revised Version advances the same great truths with crystal clarity and profound simplicity. Don't miss the great gift this new and more accessible work is to every serious believer!<br> <br> John D. Beckett, Chairman: The Beckett Companies/ Author: Loving Monday and Mastering Monday<br> <br> Pastoral ministry is complicated, particularly in our culture that is increasingly pluralistic. Often time we are pressed from both sides of the postmodern quest: on the one hand we are pressured to embrace diversity without judgment, acceptance without principle but on the other, we long for solid identity and desire authentic communities. I found David Bryant's book "Christ is All" a refreshing reminder and the voice of a prophetic advocate of the Word of God: Christ is the only answer! Unless we thirst after our Redeemer and seek to grow to His likeness, we will always be the slaves of our culture and found ourselves being tossed around by the current thoughts and philosophies. This condensed edition of David's work makes it highly readable yet remains faithful to the original version.<br> <br> Wilson Chang, Pastor, Rutgers Community Christian Church<br> <br> My faith soars when I contemplate David Bryant&#x2019;s scriptural review of the glory and supremacy of Christ. My heart is sobered when I consider his message of how we have strayed from our true calling in Jesus. My vision is stretched when I challenge myself with his practical solutions. I believe this book has prophetically touched the heart of the Church&#x2019;s greatest need today.<br> Don Peter, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering, Seattle Pacific University<br> I have had the privilege to receive seven years of good theological training, but the best Christology I have heard comes from David Bryant. This is one reason I am so excited to endorse Christ Is All! Remixed. Oh, how we need to be saturated in the wonder of Jesus Christ! May the Lord use this smaller version to bring this vital message to a larger portion of the Body of Christ. <br> Dennis Fuqua, Executive Director, International renewal Ministries, www.prayersummits.net / Author: Living Prayer: the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer Alive in You &#x2013; www.livingprayer.net<br> Next to the Bible itself, Christ Is All! is the most transforming Christology text that I have ever encountered. My appreciation for the Supremacy of God&#x2019;s Son has taken a quantum leap.<br> <br> Gary L. Frost, President, Concerts Of Prayer Greater New York.<br> <br> David Bryant is among the most gifted and passionate followers of Jesus Christ I have ever known. I pray that this remarkable volume will bless, encourage and motivate you to love and serve Jesus Christ with all of your heart, soul, strength and mind."<br> Paul Cedar, Chairman, Mission America Coalition<br> <br> The author of Hebrews reminds us that Jesus is "the centerpiece of everything" (Hebrews 3:1, The Message). David Bryant&#x2019;s Christ is All is the most definitive book next to the Bible itself ever written to substantiate this claim.<br> Dr. Dick Eastman, International President, Every Home for Christ<br> <br> When the church fully understands the beauty, humility and grandeur of Jesus Christ it will bow down to the Father in gratitude and reverence. As a man fully devoted to the proclamation of the gospel throughout the world, David Bryant adorns the doctrine of Christ in Christ is All in such a way to give the reader a taste of the glory of God. <br> Matthew W. Bennett, Founder and President, The Christian Union<br> <br> A Latin American theologian wrote that, "Hope is hearing the music of the future, faith is to dance to it." By that reckoning, David Bryant's stirring and timely book will set your toes to tapping and your heart beating faster as you pray for Christ's kingdom to come. The church needs to hear this message of hope in Christ as never before. <br> <br> Ben Patterson, Campus Pastor, Westmont College, Santa Barbara, California</p><h2>Mythologies</h2><p>In this magnificent collection of essays, Barthes explores the myths of mass culture taking subjects as diverse as wrestling, films, plastic and cars, deciphering the symbols and signs within familiar aspects of modern life and, in so doing, unmasking the hidden ideologies and meanings which implicitly affect our thought and behaviour.</p><p>Roland Barthes was born in 1915 and studied French literature and classics at the University of Paris.

Lee marched his Army of Northern Virginia into Maryland in early September 1862, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan moved his reorganized and revitalized Army of the Potomac to meet him. The campaign included some of the bloodiest, most dramatic, and influential combat of the entire Civil War. Combined with Southern failures in the Western Theater, the fighting dashed the Confederacy&#x2019;s best hope for independence, convinced President Abraham Lincoln to announce the Emancipation Proclamation, and left America with what is still its bloodiest day in history.<br><br>One of the campaign&#x2019;s participants was Ezra A. Carman, the colonel of the 13th New Jersey Infantry. Wounded earlier in the war, Carman would achieve brigade command and fight in more than twenty battles before being mustered out as a brevet brigadier general. After the horrific fighting of September 17, 1862, he recorded in his diary that he was preparing &#x201c;a good map of the Antietam battle and a full account of the action.&#x201d; Unbeknownst to the young officer, the project would become the most significant work of his life.<br><br>Appointed as the &#x201c;Historical Expert&#x201d; to the Antietam Battlefield Board in 1894, Carman and the other members solicited accounts from hundreds of veterans, scoured through thousands of letters and maps, and assimilated the material into the hundreds of cast iron tablets that still mark the field today. Carman also wrote an 1,800-page manuscript on the campaign, from its start in northern Virginia through McClellan&#x2019;s removal from command in November 1862. Although it remained unpublished for more than a century, many historians and students of the war consider it to be the best overall treatment of the campaign ever written.<br><br>Dr. Thomas G. Clemens (editor), recognized internationally as one of the foremost historians of the Maryland Campaign, has spent more than two decades studying Antietam and editing and richly annotating Carman&#x2019;s exhaustively written manuscript. The result is 'The Maryland Campaign of September 1862', Carman&#x2019;s magisterial account published for the first time in two volumes. Jammed with firsthand accounts, personal anecdotes, maps, photos, a biographical dictionary, and a database of veterans&#x2019; accounts of the fighting, this long-awaited study will be read and appreciated as battle history at its finest.<br><br>About the Authors: Ezra Ayres Carman was born in Oak Tree, New Jersey, on February 27, 1834, and educated at Western Military Academy in Kentucky.

Not only does this volume make Carman&#x2019;s study broadly accessible to students of the war, but Clemens&#x2019;s many years studying the events of September 1862 and unmatched knowledge of Carman and his work enable him to skillfully and authoritatively explain and scrutinize Carman&#x2019;s take on events. In addition to being a magnificent contribution to literature on the Civil War, this outstanding book will also advance the process of securing Clemens a place alongside Carman and Harsh in the pantheon of Maryland Campaign scholars. I cannot recommend it highly enough." (Ethan S. Rafuse, author of McClellan&#x2019;s War: The Failure of Moderation in the Struggle for the Union and Antietam, South Mountain, and Harpers Ferry: A Battlefield Guide)<br><br>"From reading the manuscript and Clemens's expert editing, one easily sees why modern Antietam scholars lean heavily upon Carman's pioneering work. One wishes all Civil War battlefields had been likewise gifted with such a worthy and dedicated veteran sponsor. Soon, with the completion of the pair of volumes comprising The Maryland Campaign of 1862, all readers will have easy and affordable access to a classic of Civil War historiography, as well as a mammoth editorial project of significant scholarship in its own right."

Atop the rickety wooden dock, soldiers paced.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Red-star jokers,&#x201d; Mergim told me, squinting into the mist-laden night. &#x201c;They inspect ship. After that everything okay. Maybe.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I leaned on a taut steel cable, gripping it tightly. The sea rumbled below: dark, listless, reeking of slimy death.&nbsp; We were five miles inside the Taedong River estuary in the Democratic People&#x2019;s Republic of Korea, or DPRK, better known as North Korea.&nbsp; Mergim scratched his unshaven face, searching my eyes for signs of panic. Apparently, he found them. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; he said, slapping me on the back. &#x201c;I come here many times. Still alive.&#x201d; As if to demonstrate, he pinched the loose skin on the back of his hand. &#x201c;You be okay.&#x201d; Then he turned back to the dock. &#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is George Sue�o. I&#x2019;m an agent for the Eighth United States Army Criminal Investigation Division in Seoul, South Korea. But now I was standing on the deck of an Albanian merchant freighter, a ship called the Star of Tirana. I was clad in unwashed woolen work pants, staring into the vast predawn darkness of Communist North Korea, wondering if this entire operation had already been exposed and, more importantly, if I&#x2019;d be tortured to death by those pacing red devils.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mergim had briefed me on what would happen once we docked, and he was telling me again in an attempt to calm me. It wasn&#x2019;t working. My fear of North Koreans, &#x201c;the enemy,&#x201d; ran too deep.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerned, Mergim reached into his dirty wool jacket and pulled out a green vial. He popped the cap. Grease-stained fingers held up a blue pill. &#x201c;You want?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook my head. If I were to survive, I would need my wits about me. I turned and stared at the dock, and the demons pacing upon it, willing myself to be calm. When a foghorn sounded, I nearly leapt off the edge of the boat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; Mergim asked, eyeing me.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said. The deck of the old merchant ship rolled slightly, or at least I thought it did.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I go work,&#x201d; Mergim said. &#x201c;You stay.&#x201d; He patted me on the shoulder. &#x201c;Take deep breath. Don&#x2019;t think too much.&#x201d;&nbsp; He turned and his soggy leather boots pounded down the iron-planked walkway.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was gone, I reached inside my crinkled canvas peacoat, making sure that my phony Peruvian<br> passport was still folded into my inner pocket. I breathed deeply, willing myself toward calmness. The tart aroma of garlic wafted on the air. This country was definitely Korea, but a different Korea than I&#x2019;d known.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My job here was clear. Once we were on dry land in this port city known as Nampo, I had to somehow make my way to the Nampo Southern Section People&#x2019;s Grain Warehouse. From weeks of studying aerial surveillance, I knew exactly where it was. The problem would be managing to evade our North Korean minders and slip away unseen from the area set aside for foreign merchant marines. Once I reached the grain warehouse&#x2014;if I ever did&#x2014;I&#x2019;d be escorted elsewhere by a contact who would be waiting for me, a former soldier who went by the name of Hero Kang. That&#x2019;s all I knew about him. That and a password. If he betrayed me&#x2014;or if Mergim betrayed me&#x2014;I&#x2019;d be lost in a world of pain. The North Koreans had tortured<br> Americans before, most notably the crew of the USS Pueblo, a U.S. reconnaissance vessel captured on the<br> high seas. The sailors had been beaten, hanged by their thumbs, left naked in their cells, and subjected to weeks of brutal interrogation. Those who survived the ordeal were released from captivity less than five years before. The others were returned in coffins.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We docked with a thud. Sailors tossed thick ropes from the deck and dockhands scurried below to secure them.&nbsp; After a gangplank was lowered, uniformed men scrambled aboard&#x2014;two squads, I figured&#x2014;all of them armed with AK-47s.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The skipper of our little boat, Captain Skander, was already standing on deck. He had a long gray beard and a protruding belly, but in the glare of the overhead floodlights he held himself like an admiral, shoulders thrust back. In my few days aboard, I&#x2019;d developed loyalty for this ship and crew despite myself. The crew was mostly Albanians, and a smattering of other nationalities. I was proud that Captain Skander seemed so courageous amid this sea of swarming Korean Communists. Although I knew that Albanians were technically Communists themselves, these Albanians didn&#x2019;t seem like Communists. They seemed like workingmen on the sea&#x2014;hustlers all, corrupt certainly, but okay guys.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; North Koreans in brown uniforms and round helmets secured the deck, motioning for the crew to step back. We did. Finally, an officer climbed aboard. He was older than the other Koreans and had gold piping along the red epaulets lining his shoulder. He stepped toward Captain Skander and they conversed quietly. In English, I thought, because I caught a few words: &#x201c;. . . inspection . . . contraband . . . manifest . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For most of the trip I&#x2019;d been clueless about the chatter surrounding me because the main language spoken aboard was Albanian. In Kuala Lumpur, where I&#x2019;d been sent by military intelligence to wait while they arranged my passage, three sailors from the Star of Tirana became unexpectedly sick only hours after they docked. Desperate for a strong back to help below with cargo, they&#x2019;d hired me. I&#x2019;d been aboard ship now for almost a month. We&#x2019;d worked our way north along the Pacific coast of Asia, first to Hanoi, then Hong Kong, then Shanghai, and finally across the Yellow Sea to Nampo.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to my passport, I was Jos� Aracadio Medin, an experienced cargo handler who&#x2019;d been stranded in Kuala Lumpur after the owners of his previous ship had gone bankrupt. In fact, what I knew about working on the sea could fit into a tin teacup, but Mergim had been well paid to watch out for me and show me what to do&#x2014;paid an additional stipend on the side, not by his ostensible employer but by someone who was in the employ of either the South Korean government or the United States government.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which one, I knew better than to ask.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of this had been arranged. I never could have set it up myself.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The North Korean officer barked a command. The entire crew, along with Captain Skander, was herded into the forecastle. Then the armed North Koreans started a systematic search of the ship. The sailors grumbled, complaining because they&#x2019;d been rousted out of their racks so quickly that they hadn&#x2019;t brought either cigarettes or matches. Despite their bellyaching, no one dared confront the armed boarding party. The captain sat down on an impromptu stool of wound hemp rope, looking resigned. It took the better part of two hours for the Koreans to complete their search. When they were done, Captain Skander was called across the deck to report to the North Korean officer.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they talked, the Korean officer lit up a cigarette and held it with the tips of his fingers. He gazed into the still dark sky. Apparently, accusations were made. Captain Skander waved his arms as he spoke. The North Korean officer didn&#x2019;t even bother to look at him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mergim, squatting beside me, tensed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to ask what the problem was but resisted the temptation because I didn&#x2019;t want to draw attention to myself. On this entire voyage I&#x2019;d been as low-key as possible, making no friends among the crew except for Mergim. Mergim was in my work group, by design, and while on the job I mainly mimicked what he was doing. I wasn&#x2019;t sure if Captain Skander was privy to our charade. I hoped not. The fewer who knew that an American soldier was aboard this freighter, the better.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the North Korean officer and Captain Skander argued, I regained my composure. This was beginning to look suspiciously like a shakedown. Maybe the North Korean customs officer and Captain Skander would haggle, a price would be settled upon and paid, and everyone would go about their business. That&#x2019;s what I thought back then. As I learned more about the DPRK, I would come to realize that nothing is ever simple.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the two men came to some sort of resolution.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Captain Skander returned scowling.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two armed Koreans emerged from below decks holding plastic packages wrapped in gauze tape. They set the packages on the deck. When their commander nodded, one of them pulled a knife from his belt and sliced open the first package. He held a pinch of the brownish powder up to the light. The commander asked where he&#x2019;d found it, and the soldier replied. Other than the Koreans themselves, I was probably the only man on deck who understood them. They&#x2019;d found it in one of the sailors&#x2019; sea bags.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The package was slashed with Chinese characters. When the beam from a flashlight passed across the thick ink, I was able to read them. <i>Antler horn. </i>A highly prized aphrodisiac used in Chinese medicine. But, like all personal business transactions, selling it was illegal in North Korea.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The powdered horn of the Siberian caribou could be legitimately obtained only as a gift from the Great Leader. One of the Albanians was called forward. I recognized him. A slender youth with a scraggly red beard named Zarkos.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The North Korean officer barked at him in English, &#x201c;Is this yours?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zarkos stood dumbfounded, not understanding.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Captain Skander stepped forward to translate. Once he understood, Zarkos stroked his beard nervously and shook his head. Then he launched into a long tirade I didn&#x2019;t understand, the gist of which, according to Mergim, was that the powder wasn&#x2019;t his and he didn&#x2019;t know how it had landed in his sea bag. The North Korean officer was unimpressed. He said something softly to his men, and two of them stepped forward and rammed the butts of their rifles into the young man&#x2019;s back. He shrieked in pain. The men around me surged forward, but the business ends of half-a-dozen AK-47s immediately trained on them. The sailors backed off. Zarkos struggled briefly but was overcome by a Korean, who deftly knotted his arms behind his back.<br> With the help of two more members of the boarding party, they shoved Zarkos toward the gangplank.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Captain Skander roared in protest, but the North Korean officer ignored him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Zarkos had been hauled ashore, the Korean officer, puffing serenely on his cigarette, stepped in front of the sailors. &#x201c;My name is Commander Koh,&#x201d; he said in Korean. A young Korean soldier translated. &#x201c;Welcome to paradise!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Albanian sailors shifted their weight, hunched their shoulders, and glanced surreptitiously at one another. None of them laughed, a tribute to their long experience with living in Communist regimes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Our country is paradise,&#x201d; Commander Koh continued, &#x201c;because our Great Leader, the shining light of our people, hero of the Korean War, and fearless general of our invincible forces, provides us with all our wants and needs. You are fortunate to be here, in this land of plenty, even if it is for only these few short days.&#x201d; Commander Koh paused, took a last drag on his cigarette, and flicked it overboard. &#x201c;Your ship has passed inspection. All except the man who&#x2019;s been taken ashore. He will be competently dealt with. The rest of you will be guests of our Great Leader tonight in the People&#x2019;s Hall of International Friendship. Due to the open heart and generous spirit of our Great Leader, entertainment will be provided.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Below us on the dock, Zarkos had somehow broken free from his captors. He struggled toward the gangplank, but his dash for freedom was cut short by an alert soldier&#x2019;s swift kick to the groin. Zarkos curled into a ball, rolling on the deck and moaning in pain. His body convulsed and he vomited onto the splintered planks.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The entertainment begins at eighteen hundred hours,&#x201d; Commander Koh continued, ignoring the performance below. &#x201c;You will not be late.&#x201d; Then he turned away, adding, <i>&#x201c;Kutna.&#x201d; </i>Finished. The entire armed boarding party retreated down the gangplank.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Captain Skander stared helplessly as Zarkos was dragged away. When the groaning sailor disappeared<br> from view, the captain turned and spoke to the men in a somber tone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, Mergim explained that Captain Skander believed that the bastard North Koreans only wanted money. It was routine with them. The North Koreans would negotiate a deal with the Albanian shipping cooperative and the contract would be signed, but all along the North Koreans would consider the price too low and make plans to extort more money to bring the contract up to a level they thought appropriate. Captain Skander assured the crew that the shipping cooperative would come up with the money and Zarkos would be freed and back aboard before the Star of Tirana left Nampo.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grumbling, the sailors returned to their duties.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mergim agreed with Captain Skander&#x2019;s analysis. For one thing, the powder that the North Koreans called antler horn was too finely ground to be a natural product from Siberian caribou. &#x201c;Customers want chunks,&#x201d; Mergim explained, &#x201c;to see what they&#x2019;re buying. Then they grind it down themselves. That stuff in those packages is some other kind of powder, not real antler horn.&#x201d; Then Mergim added, &#x201c;The red-star jokers want to show us who&#x2019;s boss. Every time I come here, they push sailors. Push too hard sometimes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he left, I stood at the railing alone, holding my hands in front of me to make sure the quivering had stopped. Then I went below to help with the cargo.</p><h2>Earth Angel Realms: Revised and Updated Information for Incarnated Angels, Elementals, Wizards and Other Lightworkers</h2><p>Learn about the newest Earth Angel realms in this revised and updated edition of <b>Doreen Virtue</b>'s bestselling book <i>Realms of the Earth Angels</i> (formerly titled <i>Earth Angels</i>).

Answering their country&#39;s call to duty, nearly two million brave British citizens--some of whom couldn&#39;t even swim--joined the Royal Navy.

Is it religion? What exactly is the Design Revolution?Today scientists, mathematicians and philosophers in the intelligent design movement are challenging a certain view of science--one that limits its investigations and procedures to purely law-like and mechanical explanations. They charge that there is no scientific reason to exclude the consideration of intelligence, agency and purpose from truly scientific research. In fact, they say, the practice of science often does already include these factors! As the intelligent design movement has gained momentum, questions have naturally arisen to challenge its provocative claims. In this book William A. Dembski rises to the occasion clearly and concisely answering the most vexing questions posed to the intelligent design program. Writing with nonexperts in mind, Dembski responds to more than sixty questions asked by experts and nonexperts alike who have attended his many public lectures, as well as objections raised in written reviews. The Design Revolution has begun. Its success depends on how well it answers the questions of its detractors. Read this book and you'll have a good idea of the prospects and challenges facing this revolution in scientific thinking.</p><p>William Dembski (Ph.D., mathematics, University of Chicago; Ph.D., philosophy, University of Illinois at Chicago) is senior fellow of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture. He has previously taught at Northwestern University, the University of Notre Dame, and the University of Dallas. He has done postdoctoral work in mathematics at MIT, in physics at the University of Chicago, and in computer science at Princeton University, and he has been a National Science Foundation doctoral and postdoctoral fellow. Dembski has written numerous scholarly articles and is the author of the critically acclaimed <em>The Design Inference</em> (Cambridge), <em>Intelligent Design</em> (InterVarsity Press) and <em>No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased without Intelligence</em> (Rowman and Littlefield).Is intelligent design (ID) thinly veiled creationism? Or perhaps simply anti-evolutionary resentment? Dembski (truly one of the pillars of ID) fields the easy questions as well as the tough ones, and Grover Gardner gives Dembski voice in covering this dense material. In a measured and conversational tone, Gardner brings to life some of the complexities of this field: Michael Behe's theory of irreducible complexity, evolution's information theory� ID-specific quandaries such as "the Wedge document," and ID's supposed religious implications. But while Gardner does everything possible to make this accessible, the material will be difficult to grasp for anyone not steeped in the debate. Dembski's honest assessment of this approach to scientific inquiry might not be the checkmate move his camp anticipates.

These two titles in Venezia's long-running Getting to Know the World's Greatest Artists series offer biographical information as well as some basic art history. In <i>Diego Velazquez</i>, for instance, children will learn that seventeenth-century patrons often relied on portraits to "show off [their] power and wealth," a fact that may help them better appreciate the lavish attire and glittery jewels on display in many of the artist's major works. <i>Winslow Homer</i> puts the engraver turned painter in context of the nineteenth-century art scene, contrasting his rustic, naturalistic style with the mannered classicism preferred by other painters of the day. The absence of a glossary and an index in the books may frustrate report writers, and statements such as "Winslow didn't care what critics thought" seem a bit bold without source citations. However, the unusually abundant full-color reproductions more than justify this series' longevity, as do Venezia's lighthearted cartoons, which foster welcome associations between "art appreciation" and "fun." <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This book dispenses with the common assumption that a hill must be at least 2000ft high to be worth climbing. Instead it concentrates on listing all the hills that are relatively high compared to the surrounding land (Marilyns) leading to some interesting results: for example, the highest points in the Cotswolds and Chilterns, Campsies and Quantocks are all included, as well as the main summits on numerous Scottish islands, whereas well-known mountain summits such as Cairn Gorm, Bowfell and Carnedd Dafydd do not qualify. As well as being an invaluable reference work for all walkers, this book contains a fascinating collection of not too serious facts and figures.

Mohammed Hanif's outrageous debut novel, <i>A Case of Exploding Mangoes</i>, tracks at least two (and as many as a half-dozen) assassination vectors to their convergence in the plane crash, incorporating elements as diverse as venom-tipped sabers, poison gas, the curses of a scorned First Lady, and a crow impaired by an overindulgence of ripe mangoes. The book has been aptly compared to <i>Catch-22</i> for its hilarious (though not quite as madcap) skewering of the Pakistani military and intelligence infrastructure, but it also can trace its lineage to Don DeLillo, doing for Pakistan what <i>Libra</i> did for JFK conspiracy theory, and Kafka's <i>The Trial</i>, with its paranoid-but-true take on pathological bureaucracy. Recent events pushing Pakistan into the worst kind of headlines make <i>A Case of Exploding Mangoes</i> a timely and entertaining read, and when a mysterious bearded man called "OBL" makes an appearance at a Fourth of July party for U.S. military brass, we're coolly reminded of the fickleness of opportunistic policy in unpredictable lands. --<i>Jon Foro</i> <br><br> <b>Mohammed Hanif on his experience in the Pakistan Air Force Academy</b> <p></p>Once upon a time, when I was eighteen, I found myself locked up in Pakistan Air Force Academy's cell along with my friend and partner-in-crime, Khalid Saifullah. We had thought we were doing charity work but the Academy officers obviously didn't share our ideals. We had been caught trying to help another classmate pass his chemistry exam, something he had failed to do twice already and this was his last chance to save himself from being expelled. The logistics of our rescue effort involved a wireless set improvised in the Sunday Hobbies Club, a microphone concealed in a crap bandage around the left elbow of our academically challenged friend, and a Sanyo FM radio receiver. We were running our operation from the roof top of a building next to the examination hall. We were caught red-handed whispering reversible chemical equation into the transistor. <p></p> We were in breach of every single standard operating procedure in the Academy rule book, and faced certain expulsion. We had just started our glorious careers and now we faced the prospect of being sent home and having to explain to our parents how, instead of training to become gentlemen-officers, we were running an exam-cheating-mafia from the rooftop of the most well-disciplined training institute in the country. <p></p> For two days, while we waited in that cell to find out about our fate, we planned our future. Khalid, always the world-wise in this outfit, immediately decided that he was going to join the merchant navy and travel the world. I tried hard to think what I would do. I came from a farming family where even the most adventurous members of our clan had only managed to branch out into planting sugarcane instead of potatoes. Education, jobs, careers were absolutely alien concepts. The Academy was supposed to be my escape from a lifetime that revolved around wildly fluctuating potato crop cycles. And here I was, already a prisoner of sorts, facing a journey back to a life I thought I had left behind. <p></p> "Maybe I&#x2019;ll become a teacher," I said vaguely. The farmers in my village used to show some vague respect to teachers in the primary school I attended. "Or a mechanic." I was a member of the car-maintenance club in the hobbies club after all. It was considered an elite club since there was no car to maintain. It was basically a hobbies club for people who hated hobbies. <p></p> "You can&#x2019;t even change a bloody tire," Khalid reminded me. <p></p> We managed to stave off the impending expulsion through a combination of confession and denial: we lied (we were listening to cricket commentary on the transistor radio), we grovelled (we were ashamed, ashamed, ashamed of our unofficer like behaviour) and we pleaded our undying passion for defending the borders of our motherland. They looked at our relatively clean record, our sterling academic achievements and let us off the hook and awarded us a punishment considered just short of expulsion. We were barred from entering the Academy&#x2019;s TV room--and from walking. For forty-one days. During the punishment period, we had to stay in uniform from dawn till dusk and when ever we were required to go from point a to b we had to run. Khalid went on to become a fairly good marathon runner (before, years later, dying in an air crash, while trying to pull a spectacular but impossible manoeuvre in Mirage fighter plane). I discovered Academy's library. I had barely noticed that the college had a very well-stocked library. We knew it was there, we occasionally used it as a quiet corner to hatch conspiracies but I had never noticed that the long rambling hall was lined with cupboards full of books. All the cupboards were locked, but you could see pristine untouchable books behind their glass doors. The librarian, an eagle-nosed old civilian, walked around with a large bunch of jangling keys although his wares were not in any danger of being stolen. I was to find out later that he was quite a professional. The library was immaculately catalogued. You could of course go to him, fill out a form and request a book. But I never actually saw anybody fill out a form. I spent some afternoons staring at the books from behind the glass doors as my classmates watched videos in the TV room (including the fellow who had scraped through his chemistry exam and survived but would die years later in our current president's General Pervez Musharraf&#x2019;s moronic military adventure in Kargil on India-Pakistan border). <p></p> How do you ask for a book when you are eighteen and have been brought up in a household where the only book was the Quran and the only reading material an occasional old newspaper left behind by a visitor from the city? "I want that book," I asked the librarian pointing tentatively towards a cupboard which contained a thick volume of something called <i>The Great Escapes</i>. The librarian, relieved at having found a customer, took out his bunch of keys, removed a key and asked me to go get it myself. I took my time and browsed for a long time before filling out the form and borrowing the book. So grateful was I for getting that book that I brought him a samosa and cup of tea next day. That turned out to be a very good investment as the librarian handed me the bunch of his keys as soon as I entered. I browsed randomly, recklessly, reading first paragraphs and author bios, and made na�ve judgments. <i>The Cross of Iron</i> wasn&#x2019;t a religious thriller but a war novel. <i>Crime and Punishment</i> had very little crime in it. Was Rushdie related to the famous pop singer Ahmed Rushdie? Mario Puzo and Mario Vargas Llosa. The strange covers of Borges. Abdullah Hussain, I had heard of. A whole shelf devoted to Gabriel Garcia Marquez. <i>Chronicle</i>. Was that little book about the wrecked ship really a true story? I didn&#x2019;t know which one was a thriller and which one was literary. <i>As I Lay Dying</i>--sounds like a nice title so let&#x2019;s read it. So does <i>Valley of the Dolls</i>. It is probably not the right way to read. Discovering books was like a discovering a second adolescence. I discovered new sensations in my body. It was even better. It was guilt-free and I could show off. Not that anyone except my librarian friend was impressed. <p></p> Outside the library, the world revolved around parade square, hockey fields and series of punishments and rewards that didn&#x2019;t seem very different from each other. The vocabulary used to run the Academy life comprised of about fifty words, half of which were variations on the word 'balls.' Every order began or ended with balls, it was used as verb, adjective, qualifier or just simply a howl. Balls to you. Balls to mother, my balls, I'll cut your balls.... Every order, every threat, every compliment was a variation on the same testicular theme. Now that I look back at, it is quite obvious that this place was drowning in its own testosterone. <p></p> From outside, life could seem orderly. Uniforms were starched, rifles were oiled and sessions on the parade square hard and long. I yearned for that jangling of the keys in the library corridors. Once I was caught in my Navigation class reading <i>Notes from the Underground</i> hidden under a map that I was supposed to be studying. After our second year in the Academy, there were sudden attempts to turn us into good Muslims. Compulsory prayers. Quran lectures. Islamic Studies classes. In the third year we were caught stealing oranges from a neighbourhood orchard and as a punishment we were sent out to a mosque outside the Academy where Muslim cousins of Jehovah's Witnesses taught us how to knock on random doors and preach Islam. <p></p> "But they are all Muslims," I had protested. <p></p> "So are you," came the reply. "And look at yourself." <p></p> At that time I didn&#x2019;t realise that we were an experiment in Islamisation of the whole society. General Zia was a distant presence. He was our commander-in-chief and the permanent president of Pakistan. He thought he was never going to die. So did we. <p></p> Years later, sitting in the officers' mess of a Karachi air base, we heard about the plane crash that killed him and several other generals. We were sad about the pilots and the crew of the plane. To drown our sorrows we pooled our meagre savings, ordered a bottle of Black Label whiskey, and instead of hiding in our bachelor quarters as we normally did, we opened the bottle in the officers' mess TV room and discussed our future. I left the air force a month later. <p></p> <i>--Mohammed Hanif</i>Mohammed Hanif was born in Okara, Pakistan.

The book reassesses de Kooning`s critical status as one of America`s greatest and most influential artists, examines the complexity of his painting techniques, and places him in the context of other artists and art movements of his era. The book serves as the catalogue for a major exhibition of de Kooning`s work presented at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the Metropolitan Museum in New York, and the Tate Gallery in London.</p><p>Abstract expressionist Willem de Kooning turns 90 this spring, and this handsome catalogue of a large retrospective at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., (which later travels to Manhattan's Metropolitan Museum) celebrates his virtuosity and ever-changing idioms. Aided by 80 color and 50 black-and-white plates, exhibit curator Prather presents commentaries on specific groups of paintings, such as the somber, enigmatic male figures from the 1930s, the urban and pastoral abstract landscapes of the '50s, the blossoming fields of color from the '70s and the feathery, luminous abstractions of the mid-1980s. Sylvester, an art critic, examines de Kooning's indebtedness to cubism as well as his influence on such artists as Joan Mitchell and Francis Bacon. Shiff, an art history professor at the University of Texas, provocatively explores de Kooning's preoccupation with certain recurring body features--eyes, mouth, breasts, genitals, feet--and shows how he fused the clasical tradition of nudity with contemporary styles in advertising and pop imagery. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Arriving in the United States as an illegal immigrant from Rotterdam in 1926, de Kooning became one of the most influential American painters of this century and a pioneer of Abstract Expressionism. This handsome catalog of 76 major works chronicles over 50 year of the artist's slashing style and shows how he freely moved between figure and abstract painting, changing focus throughout his career and often blurring the line between the two. David examines de Kooning's indebtedness to Cubism and influence on such artists as Francis Bacon and Joan Mitchell, Richard explores recurring themes and iconography, and Prather comments on groups of paintings from the 1930s to mid-1980s. This is de Kooning's best show ever. Essential for academic and museum libraries.<br><i>Russell T. Clement, Brigham Young Univ.

Ebola.<br><br>These are the weapons of the future-- microscopic organisms produced in laboratories and unleashed on unwitting populations to reproduce, spread, and kill. They are as deadly as atomic bombs, much cheaper to create, and much easier to distribute-- inside a warhead on an intercontinental missile, in an aerosol can sprayed in a crowded building, or by a crop duster flying over a major city. Exposure occurs without warning. Infection from only a few minute particles can mean a ghastly and painful death. The kill rates are staggering.<br><br>Modern biological warfare began during the 1930s, when the Japanese army conducted atrocious experiments on Chinese prisoners using lethal bacteria. During the Cold War, both the Soviet Union and the U.S. rushed to build biological-weapons programs. In 1972, the Biological Weapons Convention banned the development of bioweapons, supposedly ending the threat.<br><br>But the threat was only beginning.<br><br><i>Plague Wars </i>tells the stories of the secret battles that are still being waged in many nations, stories filled with international espionage, deceptions, and treachery. Recently, defectors and covert sources from Third World governments such as Iraq have revealed active biological-weapons programs, despite international arms inspectors' attempts to eradicate them. A U.S. war game to prepare for a North Korean biological attack went so horribly wrong that the results are still classified. In South Africa the use of bioweapons represents one of the last untold secrets of the apartheid battles, while in Zimbabwe people are still dying of anthrax from the dirty wars of independence fought two decades ago. Fringe cults, apocalyptic madmen, and terrorist groups everywhere claim to own bioweapons and are threatening to use them. Major Western cities are busily planning defense against such an attack.<br><br>The Plague Wars have begun. Are we prepared?<br><br>Researched across four continents with exceptional access to many sources from the United Nations, U.S. Department of Defense, and various civilian and military intelligence agencies, and using previously classified government documents, Tom Mangold and Jeff Goldberg have written the definitive account of the state of biological warfare in the world today. Never before has the complete scope of these terrifying weapons been so thoroughly examined.<br><br>A startling look into hidden facets of history, dark secrets of the present, and the anticipated horrors of a none-too-distant future, <i>Plague Wars </i>will make you reconsider your safety in a world where death is just a breath away.<br></p><p>Tom Mangold is a senior correspondent in London for BBC TV's <i>Panorama</i>.

It was a scorching Manila morning, and in thirty minutes Ali would go to war with Joe Frazier for the third and final time. Ali yawned and stared at the ceiling of his dressing room. "Just another day's work," he said. "Just gotta go beat on another man." The reporter did what a reporter is supposed to do. He listened and wrote down Ali's words.</p><p>And so began just another day's work for Dick Schaap, who in the past half-century has carved out his own legend, not with his fists but with his reportorial verve, his indefatigable curiosity, and his irrepressible wit. Now, in <em>Flashing Before My Eyes</em>, the longtime ABC correspondent and host of ESPN"s <em>The Sports Reporters</em> recounts a charmed career in which he has met almost everyone and seen almost everything. He has played golf with Bill Clinton, tennis with Bobby Fischer, cards with Wilt Chamberlain. He has written books with Joe Namath and Joe Montana. He has taken Brigitte Bardot to dinner and Lenny Bruce to a World Series. He saw the Baltimore Colts beat the New York Giants in sudden-death overtime, and the Green Bay Packers beat the Dallas Cowboys in the Ice Bowl. He saw Bill Mazeroski end a World Series with a home run, and Willis Reed lift the New York Knicks to an NBA title. He has covered murders and riots, presidential campaigns and Broadway openings. He introduced Muhammad Ali to Billy Crystal, and Billy Crystal to Joe DiMaggio. He walks with sluggers and senators, cops and comedians, authors and actresses, and he shares the sights he sees and the words he hears in stories that make you laugh and cry.</p><p>With an introduction by <em>Tuesdays with Morrie</em> author Mitch Albom, Schaap's memoir gives the reader the ultimate highlight reel of the last fifty years and makes a compelling case that if Dick Schaap wasn't there to see it, it didn't happen.</p><p></p></p><p>Dick Schaap, it seems, knows everyone. He would easily win at Six Degrees of Separation. Heck, he would win at Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. As a matter of fact, he probably golfs with Kevin Bacon. I wouldn't be surprised, since Schaap has golfed with Bill Clinton and played doubles tennis against Johnny Carson, and he regularly dines with Billy Crystal. Oh, and Muhammad Ali is one of his oldest friends. But Schaap is also a guy who remembers his teammates on the Freeport Barons (winners of the New York State Kiwanis League Championship '49 <i>and</i> '50) in fond and humorous detail. It is his true love for and fascination with people that make <i>Flashing Before My Eyes</i> such a delight to read.<p> Born in Brooklyn, Schaap was a smart kid with an outsized love for the Dodgers. By the age of 15 he was a sports reporter for the <i>Nassau Daily Review-Star</i>, where he worked under 20-year-old Jimmy Breslin, who became a lifelong friend. From there Schaap moved on to Cornell University and then to <i>Newsweek</i>, where he learned to write "short and tight. The end of the world? Give me eight hundred words. The end of the World Series. Maybe five hundred." With more than 50 years in journalism, over 30 books to his name, and five Emmys, there's no debating that Schaap is a storyteller extraordinaire. Page after page of <i>Flashing Before My Eyes</i> rolls by as you snort and chortle at Schaap's stories (and sometimes Schaap himself; he doesn't spare the pen), but then he slides in a moment that makes you tear up. Mitch Albom, who wrote the introduction, says of Schaap, "His cross-referencing would put Microsoft Access to shame. You can say to Dick, 'Pass the ketchup,' and he will reply, 'Did I ever tell you about Bobby 'Catch-Up' Johnson, the one-legged soccer player I met in Belgium?'" Schaap on sports, Schaap on comedy, Schaap on politics--these we've enjoyed for years.

The first publication of <em>Son of Oscar Wilde</em> in 1954 was a daring endeavor, considering that homosexuality remained a crime in England at that time, and his father had been convicted of that crime.<br> Now available with a new Foreword by Merlin Holland, Vyvyan Holland's son, this memoir--which Vyvyan Holland described as "not a very amusing or entertaining story"--reveals Oscar Wilde as a much-loved though often absent member of the family. Focusing on the scandal from the point of view of a small boy, it dramatically portrays how the family dealt with Oscar's persecution, and after his death, attempted to deny that he ever lived by taking the extreme measure of changing the sons' names from Wilde to Holland. Vyvyan Holland describes in detail his early happy years followed by the exile and his years in Germany and Monaco, his return to England and his adolescent years, and his decision as a mature adult to lay to rest the bitter memory of his early years by recording them for posterity.<br> This edition also contains 33 of Oscar Wilde's letters to friends; a reminiscence of Wilde by W.W. Ward; some prose poems by Wilde; letters from Lord Alfred Douglas to Vyvyan Holland; and several contemporary newspaper reports of events during and after the Oscar Wilde affair. A tragic story of prejudice, fear, and much sadness, this memoir reveals one boy's ability to survive such extreme cruelty and suffering.</p><p>This is the first of what no doubt will be many volumes (see below) on Wilde to celebrate the centennial of his death in 2000. Holland's somewhat syrupy portrait of his father, whom he really didn't know well as he was only four when Oscar died, nonetheless won high praise from critics when it was released in 1954. This edition has been updated by Holland's son Merlin. The volume also contains several monochrome photos of the players. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc."A biographical tour de force" -- <i>Observer</i><br><br>"An essential addition to Wildeana by a witness uniquely qualified to testify" -- <i>Library Journal</i><br><br>"Fascinating for the light it sheds on Wilde's Oxford days and on his domestic life." -- <i>Atlantic Monthly</i><br><br>"Mr. Holland's vivid glimpses of the aftermath of that cause clbre of the Nineties [do] a valuable service of his father's memory." -- <i>Saturday Review</i></p><h2>Go, Dog.

Her work in film and sculpture explores how power is articulated through relationships, often focusing on the body and materiality in relation to narratives of nationalism and histories of place. This book accompanies the first solo museum presentation of the artist in the Nordic region, at Henie Onstad Kunstsenter, and traces her distinctive work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Manna was born in the United States and grew up in Jerusalem. Her relationship to Norway began in 2006 when she was a student at the Oslo National Academy of the Arts, and started an artistic inquiry into the relations between her home territory&#x2015;Palestine&#x2015;and this new Arctic country. Manna has developed a body of work that has received acclaim from the region's local artistic community; in 2017, she was among the artists chosen to exhibit at the Nordic Pavilion at the 57th Venice Biennale. &nbsp;</p><p>The title of the current publication reveals the various connotations of scale present in Manna's practice. From the flat film screen to the three-dimensional space of her sculptures, scale is an instrument for Manna's archaeological explorations of classification methods and biological processes. Included in this book are stills from the film <i>Wild Relatives</i> (2018), a meditative documentary capturing the transit of seeds between the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway and the fields of the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. Alongside the film are two installations that question archival practices and plant taxonomy (<i>Cache (Insurance Policy)</i>, 2018; and <i>Post Herbarium</i>, 2016). The remaining two installations present the fragmented body in relation to its location (<i>Adrenarchy</i>, 2018; and <i>The Contractor's Heel</i>, 2016).</p><p>Ana Mar�a Bresciani writes about Manna's investigations into scale and her focus on the migration of agricultural practices, regional cultures, and botanical species. Manna and the agronomist Salvatore Ceccarelli discuss the sharing of agricultural heritage and the safeguarding of the earth's vital resources as well as the cultural importance of groups that are tasked with managing and securing the biological diversity of their respective localities. An essay by curator Ruba Katrib considers Manna's inquiry into&nbsp; cultural stability with regard to the ancient cultures of the Levantine, and the reigning external-environmental and social forces responsible for creating a stable culture.</p><p>Copublished with Henie Onstad Kunstsenter</p><p><b>Contributors<br></b>Ana Mar�a Bresciani, Ruba Katrib, Salvatore Ceccarelli</p></p><p></p><h2>Vogue� Knitting on the Go!

Lewis, an unfailingly honest and perceptive observer of self, here shares the story of his personal spiritual journey. With characteristic candor and insight, he describes how his ''search for joy'' led him from the conventional Christianity of his childhood to a youthful atheism, and finally back to an assured Christianity compatible with his formidable intellect. Lewis's ''surprise'' holds continuing interest not only for admirers of his work but for any modern seeker concerned with the compatibility of the rational and the spiritual.</p><p>&#34;A young man who wishes to remain a sound Atheist cannot be too careful of his reading. There are traps everywhere God is, if I may say it, very unscrupulous.&#34;This book is not an autobiography. It is not a confession. It is, however, certainly one of the most beautiful and insightful accounts of a person coming to faith. In this case, that person is C.S. Lewis and his path takes us from a childhood in Belfast through the loss of his mother, to boarding school and a youthful atheism in England, to the trenches of World War I, and then to life at Oxford, where he studied, read, and, ultimately, reasoned his way back to God. It is perhaps this aspect of Surprised by Joy that we believers and nonbelievers find most compelling and meaningful; Lewis was searching for joy, for an elusive and momentary sensation of glorious yearning, but he found it, and spiritual life, through the use of reason. In this highly personal, thoughtful, intelligent memoir, Lewis guides us toward joy and toward the surprise that awaits anyone who seeks a life beyond the expected.&#34;Fascinating.&#34;--&#34;The Nation&#34;&#34;Lewis tempered his logic with a love for beauty, wonder, and magic . . . He speaks to us with all the power and life-changing force of a Plato, a Dante, and a Bunyan.&#34; &#34;Christianity Today&#34;&#34;The tension of these final chapters holds the interest like the close of a thriller God moves, indeed, in a mysterious way, and this book gives a brilliant account of one of the oddest and most decisive end-games He has ever played.&#34; &#34;Times Literary Supplement&#34; C. S. (Clive Staples) Lewis (1898 1963), one of the great writers of the twentieth century, also continues to be one of our most influential Christian thinkers. He wrote more than thirty books, both popular and scholarly, including The Chronicles of Narnia, The Screwtape Letters, The Four Loves, Mere Christianity, and Till We Have Faces.&#34;CLIVE STAPLES LEWIS (1898-1963) was one of the intellectual giants of the twentieth century and arguably the most influential Christian writer of his day. He was a Fellow and Tutor in English literature at Oxford University until 1954 when he was unanimously elected to the Chair of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge University, a position he held until his retirement. His major contributions in literary criticism, children's literature, fantasy literature, and popular theology brought him international renown and acclaim. He wrote more than thirty books, allowing him to reach a vast audience, and his works continue to attract thousands of new readers every year. His most distinguished and popular accomplishments include the <i>Chronicles of Narnia, Out of the Silent Planet, The Four Loves, The Screwtape Letters</i>, and <i>Mere Christianity</i>.</p><h2>SOAR Strategic Learning Skills for College &amp; Career Readiness</h2><p>SOAR Strategic Learning Skills is a comprehensive program that empowers students to manage their time, schoolwork, and extra-curricular activities more efficiently.

His pictures have been widely published, with dramatic, detailed close-ups his specialty. </p><p><b> The Magic of Conifers </b></p><p> 'Why should I use conifers in my garden?' is a question that anyone picking up this book might ask. The answer, I hope, will be found in the following pictures, advice and information -- conifers can add essential ingredients to a garden not easily or fully replicated by any other plants. I have spent over thirty years creating a garden with, literally, hundreds of conifers that provide interest and color the whole year round. I fully appreciate their value as well as their problems; unfortunately, it is often the latter that are highlighted by members of the gardening media who feel that conifers have little or no place in the modern garden. Gardeners in other parts of the world find it difficult to believe the paranoia that has become attached in Britain to the Leyland Cypress (x <i>Cupressocyparis leylandii</i>); this entirely innocent, fast-growing evergreen has caused costly legal disputes between neighbors simply because people plant it in the wrong places or omit to trim it. </p><p> This is not a book about Leylandii, nor is it about the negative sides of conifers, which are no more prevalent than those of any other group of plants (and will of course be covered in the text). Any fast-growing tree -- including eucalyptus, poplar or willow -- should always be chosen and placed with care. The point to make with this marvelous and varied group of mostly evergreen plants is the same as with other trees and shrubs, even perennials: consider before you buy, plan before you plant, and always take heed of growth rates and likely suitability for purpose. </p><p> Far from being dull, to the observant this group of plants can be both awe-inspiring and magical. Conifers come in all shapes and sizes -- miniatures may grow less than 3ft (90cm) in a hundred years, while others might reach 130ft (40m) or more in the same period. Conifers include the oldest living plant in the world, the ancient Bristlecone Pine, <i>Pinus longaeva</i>, whose 4,500-year-old wind-shattered specimens cling to life over 10,000ft (3,000m) up in the White Mountains of California, as well the tallest, the Coast Redwood, also in California, measuring almost 400ft (120m). If we are lucky, we can marvel at these in nature. It would not, of course, be advisable to plant a Coast Redwood in a smaller garden but, strangely enough, <i>Pinus longaeva</i> grows quite successfully at much less elevated positions, even in my garden at Bressingham in Norfolk, UK. </p><p> Conifers can be deciduous or evergreen. Among the former, the larches (<i>Larix</i>), the Swamp Cypresses (<i>Taxodium</i>) and the amazing Maidenhair Tree (<i>Ginkgo</i>) have wonderful autumn colors as their leaves turn and fall. In winter, the first two, together with the deciduous Dawn Redwood (<i>Metasequoia</i>), exhibit traceries of branches and twigs against the sky, enhanced by frost and water droplets. The evergreens can display a wonderful range of colors. It is magical to see an evergreen like <i>Pinus mugo</i> 'Wintergold' transform its green summer needles to a glowing yellow or gold in autumn -- such a cheery change can warm the heart during long winter days. </p><p> There is great interest, too, in the variety of conifer shapes -- weeping trees can take on an ethereal appearance on a misty day; frosted or snow-laden branches can sparkle in low winter sun, their burden later melting in glistening droplets. Winter, when so much else in the garden is dormant, is when conifers really come into their own. But in late spring, when the sheathed winter buds swell and burst open on spruces (<i>Picea</i>) and firs (<i>Abies</i>), smothering them in fresh new leaves, the effect is magical. That in turn can be outdone by the startling red flowers seen on many conifers as the cones begin to develop. The cones themselves can be smaller than a pea or nearly as large as a football; in their young stage, the cones of the Korean Fir (<i>Abies koreana</i>) are a rich, deep blue. </p><p> The leaves of conifers are by no means uniformly dull, green needles, as many gardeners might believe. The hues of new growth include a brilliant powder-blue, bright grass-green, orange, yellow, cream, even red and crimson. Some conifers, such as junipers, bear both prickly young and quite different coarser mature leaves at the same time; others, such as firs, spruces and pines, have bright silver-blue undersides to their leaves which are gloriously revealed when they turn to face the light. </p><p> A further wonderful asset, often overlooked, is the aromatic fragrance given by many conifers, while some junipers have quite a pungent scent. </p><p> The awe-inspiring giants of the forest -- the ancient, almost prehistoric <i>Ginkgo</i>, the <i>Metasequoia</i> and the Chilean Monkey Puzzle tree -- can all be grown today in gardens. For smaller gardens, however, a further type has added to the range -- witch's brooms. These originate as congested growths on much larger trees, and have always been associated with witchcraft. Today, collectors all over the world search forests to find interesting forms that they can propagate and offer us for our gardens.</p></p><h2>The Bread Ovens of Quebec</h2><p>This wonderful book is a &#34;unique study of the role of the bread oven in rural Quebec society [and] also gives compete instructions on how to build a traditional outdoor bread oven.&#34; This history also includes many photographs (historic and more modern).

He has edited numerous literary anthologies and written essays and reviews for periodicals nationwide.Introduction<br><br>Early on in my writing career I traveled to the Bread Loaf Writers&#x2019; Conference. I dutifully lugged several short stories carefully typed on onionskin, the watermark visible when held to the slanting sunlight. I don&#x2019;t recall the stories&#x2019; titles, but something about their spirit stays with me fiction told in the voices of people on the periphery, a serial killer speaking from the shower, a foster child somewhere on a snowy road in Utah. At Bread Loaf, I expected a Published Writer would critique my work, a man with a gold pen and a pipe, a man who hunted geese, perhaps, drank ocher-colored alcohol from a crystal decanter, and knew something about how to sail.<br> Bread Loaf was a beautiful place filled, it seemed to me, with beautiful people, parties, poetry, and dances held in haylofts. I felt awkward there, put off in part by the nature of the pursuit writing fiction and in part by the culture that sprang from the pursuit. The famous writers at Bread Loaf knew they were celebrities in this small space, and after dinner they congregated in a special lounge reserved for them, a lounge we Little Leaguers could only peek inside, standing at the windows in the field, Queen Anne&#x2019;s lace blowing hip-high and fragrant. Editors milled about the grounds, the smoky smell of their wood-paneled New York offices still clinging to their clothes.<br> I, of course, was determined to succeed, and spent my Bread Loaf days and many days thereafter laboring away on my Smith Corona, and then my first computer, words blinking up on the black screen and then daisy- wheeled into pale print. But whatever I wrote seemed wrong, seemed strained, seemed more intent on flashing its cleverness and gaining entry to the country club than on truly transcribing the content inside my admittedly mediocre head. My earliest attempts at fiction were rather tortured show, don&#x2019;t tell&#x201d; affairs, all thought and feeling crammed into action and gesture, so my characters were constantly wringing their hands or tilting their heads, as though they had a chronic case of swimmer&#x2019;s ear. The number one rule in those Bread Loaf days was to never, ever directly say what a character felt or thought. That was the stuff of expository writing, of college essays, the stuff of the middling masses who could hope to do not much more than pass their course in freshman comp.<br> The show, don&#x2019;t tell&#x201d; rule that dominated the pedagogy of fiction back then, and perhaps still does, has given rise to some fantastic work, and it remains a useful guide to writing a certain kind of story. For me, as a fledgling writer, it was a bit of a disaster. I longed to be able just to say something straight, to be able to ask on paper the sorts of questions that consumed me then and still do today, questions such as: What is a moral stance? Can despair be redemptive? Is the urge to make meaning a misguided human coping mechanism that gives a false shape to our existence? How best to live? To die?<br> Eventually I gave up on fiction, gave up in frank despair because I simply could not find a way to explore these questions through character. This was years after Bread Loaf; I was twenty-five then, and when I set down my pen a silence entered my room, a silence in which I was forced to sit, and sweat, and wait, and watch. A year went by. I worked as a literacy instructor and spent my free time in the library of the Harvard Divinity School, a place that would be soothing even to the most troubled soul, the stacks crammed with books whose titles promised revelation. In those days I was reading William James, Thomas Merton, and Paul Tillich, drinking down the pages, propelled by an intellectual thirst that I have never felt quite so keenly again.<br> And it was during this long, slow slake that I found, one afternoon in 1988, walking home from the library, my first volume of The Best American Essays. I was peering in the window of WordsWorth Books on Brattle Street, and there it was, propped up in the window, a gray book, the color of weather- beaten wood, modest and unadorned. Essays. What was an essay? A long time ago I had read Virginia Woolf&#x2019;s essays The Death of the Moth, Three Guineas and had been delighted by their thoughtful combination of imagery and exposition. One of my earliest writing memories, in fact, comes from the eighth grade, when I decided I would try to write a Woolfian type of composition. I don&#x2019;t recall its particulars, only that it seemed incredible to me that one might write a piece, a polemic, that had all the strangeness of a story but was not a story.<br> Now, twenty-five years old, I sat down to read The Best American Essays and I was transported. The first piece I read was Elizabeth Hardwick&#x2019;s Thee Heart of the Seasons,&#x201d; its language rapturous and vivid. The essay evoked time, heat, indolence, and grief through the sheer force of iiiiits imagery and voice. The essay was an artery connecting the mind of the reader with the writer, the writer bare and unpretentious, the writer without the veil of character, without the rouge and foundation that compose fiction, which is, when all is said and done, a game of dress-up. Hardwick&#x2019;s essay, when I first read it, was the literary equivalent of skinny-dipping I see you and it made me feel found.<br> So it was that I picked up my pen again and began to write, began to write directly, honestly, began to converse, showing, telling, pausing, contradicting, setting the frayed contents of my mind down on plain paper to be plainly seen by anyone who cared to look. That doesn&#x2019;t mean there isn&#x2019;t art and artifice involved in the writing of an essay. But it does mean that the art is in revealing the voice of the writer, as opposed to trying to transform it to suit the requirements of a fictional character or narrator. Essay writing is not about facts, although the essay may contain facts. Essay writing is about transcribing the often convoluted process of thought, leaving your own brand of breadcrumbs in the forest so that those who want to can find their way to your door.<br> Essays, therefore, confuse people. They occupy a quirky place in the general genre of nonfiction, a place many people seem not to understand. It has been my experience that people not acquainted with the literary essay expect it to behave like an article or a piece of journalism. Journalism is a broad category unto itself, but it is probably finally defined by its mission to report to readers clear facts that have been thoroughly investigated and digested by the journalist. One does not expect to read a piece of journalism filled with tentative reflections or outright contradictions. However, essays thrive on these, because contradiction, paradox, and questioning best reflect the moving, morphing human mind, which is what the essayist wants to capture.<br> In 2004 I published a nonfiction book called Opening Skinner&#x2019;s Box: Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century. I thought of each chapter as an essay, an inquiry into a psychological experiment and what it might mean for me during the brief time I came into contact with it. The first essay was about B. F. Skinner, who, I believed at first, had lost a daughter to suicide. I eventually found out that this was a myth: Deborah Skinner Buzan is alive, and the chapter reports this by quoting her sister to that effect. But the essay does not begin with this fact; rather, it traces my struggle to figure out the status of Deborah Skinner in body and in soul, and it emphasizes my doubts and questions along the way. If Deborah Skinner is indeed alive, I asked, then why has the myth persisted? And what does that say about B. F. Skinner in particular and behaviorism in general? My goal was to tussle with these questions and see what larger meaning might emerge from them.<br> When the book was published, Deborah Skinner reacted angrily. By my dwelling on the rumor that she had gone mad and killed herself, it seemed to her and others that I had injected the essay with false mystery. Deborah Skinner initiated a lawsuit, and soon thereafter I was cited in the press for negligent reporting. If I were a reporter, of course, my job would have been to contact and quote from my main source. But as an essayist, my interest was not in establishing the facts of a life but in mining the meaning, for me, of the questions that life had spawned. An essayist celebrates questions, loves the liminal, and feels that life is best lived between the may and the be of maybe.<br> So there was controversy surrounding the publication of Opening Skinner&#x2019;s Box. Upon hearing of it, several people said, There&#x2019;s no such thing as bad publicity.&#x201d; If you are an essayist, then you are probably not primarily interested in publicity, because no one who truly wants to be famous chooses this little genre. However, I found myself in the strange position of being quite suddenly famous. My friend and fellow writer Pagan Kennedy grumbled that there were more pieces in the New York Times on my book than there were on Iraq&#x2019;s purported weapons of mass destruction.<br> Opening Skinner&#x2019;s Box angered people in ways too numerous and too complex to mention here. Suffice it to say that Deborah Skinner Buzan&#x2019;s complaint was not the only one; it was simply the first. Soon after, hundreds of psychologists and psychiatrists in universities from coast to coast wrote comments on a listserve called Slater-Hater, the aim of which was to discredit a book they saw as highly inaccurate, full of fabrications and mistakes, and that smeared the science they had worked so hard to establish. As one contributor to the forum wrote: Slater&#x2019;s Skinner&#x2019;s Box was perhaps the first attempt to fuse the pseudo-memoir with the ordinary nonfiction science book for the general reader. I was about as happy to see that as I would be to see the first human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 bird flu virus!&#x201d; If the personal reflections that make up the essay/memoir, pseudo or otherwise, are like bird flu viruses, then essay writers are a dangerous breed indeed. I don&#x2019;t think of essays as viruses, although some part of me appreciates the power of that designation. In any case, the rage these academics displayed and continue to display toward Opening Skinner&#x2019;s Box made me curious about the workings of their minds and about the psychological dynamics that fuel scandals. So two years ago I joined the Slater-Hater listserve so I could observe what the issues were. Soon I was flooded with e-mails with such subject lines as Slater Redux,&#x201d; More Slater Caper,&#x201d; and Slater, Mean Malicious Liar or Just Mentally Ill?&#x201d; The discussion on the listserve was more barbed than I was prepared for. So was the accompanying behavior outside the listserve.<br> Being the object of such predation over an extended period of time has led me to think a lot about the critical role of kindness in writing and in life. It has led me to see that I, like the academics of whom I speak, have in the past written pieces with too much tooth, something the press generally rewards. I no longer write this way. I cannot abide ill will in my own work, and I dislike it when I see it in the work of others. I now believe that good writing, and good living, must have a core of gentleness.<br> Most of the postings on Slater-Hater were not malicious, however. More common were missives that had about them the veneer of intellect, and perhaps these troubled me even more. One professor, writing about a knotty ethical question, the type that is best explored as plainly as possible, wrote: More broadly, the logical error we&#x2019;re discussing in this case is what logicians term the genetic fallacy: the error of evaluating an argument on the basis of its origins . . . Admittedly it may be a matter of debate as to whether this fallacy is always a fallacy. From a Bayesian perspective, it may well sometimes make sense to consider the motives, training and group membership of the proponent of the view if such background characteristics have an r_0 correlation with the verisimilitude of the argument(s) in question.&#x201d; From my membership on the listserve I have learned a few things at least. One is that academia, and the discourse it gives rise to a discourse potentially relevant for the essayist, since it can and often does inform his material can be venomous, its culture darkly narcissistic. This was a surprise to me, as I thought professors in general were a little like essayists, who are narcissistic, to be sure, but in a harmless way. I also learned a lot about the language of academia, and this has helped me clarify principles I believe are relevant to the writing of good essays. Academia, at least the part I saw, thrives on jargon. For instance, it is not uncommon, on the Slater-Hater listserve, which has thankfully moved on to other discussions, to read this sort of thing: We identified the same correlates for MMPI-2point codes types in VA men as Gilberstadt and Duker did for the same MMPI two point code types 40 years earlier.&#x201d; Or, Self-esteem as a construct has a validity rating of .02% when compared to a two tailed t-test reliability rating of 4.&#x201d; The sociologist Gerald Rosen, in his study of cosmetic surgery, commented that the less secure a field of study is, the more intense is its use of jargon. This puts essayists in a tough position, because they seem to be a troubled lot, constantly picking at their own imperfections, claiming embarrassment and humility while simultaneously showcasing the scars. The essayist often brings to the writing table an odd mix of shame and showmanship, and it may well be that the tension therein is what propels the work. Joseph Epstein, in his essay The Culture of Celebrity,&#x201d; included in this volume, frets about his lack of celebrity status, and by doing so he amusingly attempts to seek the spotlight. Such narcissism is redeemed in part by the essayist&#x2019;s awareness of it, and in part by his absolute avoidance of jargon, which seems to me to be an attempt to inflate an idea or co-opt language so it becomes gilded and private. Unlike academic writing, the essay can be defined by its insistence on, and celebration of, the vernacular, a lyrical way of speaking that aims always at inclusion. The academic learns to hide his insecurity behind bloated verbiage. The essayist cannot hide his uncertainty, and by admitting it, he can hope to transform it.<br> The essays in this volume have made this transformation beautifully. They all speak plainly, the sentences scraped clean of verbal detritus, the result of which is writing that shines on the stumblings of its authors.<br> A few of the essays here are written by academics about academia. Given my experience as a member of the Slater-Hater listserve, and as the recipient of much professor-perpetrated vengefulness, I came to these essays suspiciously, if not defensively. I was, however, more than pleasantly surprised. Professor Emily Bernard&#x2019;s Teaching the N-Word&#x201d; redeems, for me, the patent primitivism of many in the academy. It is itself proof that writing from within the ivy walls, writing that springs from the soil of educational institutions, can be at once inclusive, artful, nuanced, complex, and frank.<br> The other essays in this collection cover a range of topics. Poe Ballantine reminds us that it is still possible, in the new millennium, to live a Kerouac kind of on-the-road existence, but to do so in a surprisingly thoughtful and sober if not untroubled state. Ballantine&#x2019;s writing is secure insecurity at its best, muscular and minimal, self-deprecating on the one hand, full of the self&#x2019;s soul on the other.<br> Marjorie Williams&#x2019;s devastating essay, A Matter of Life and Death,&#x201d; chilled me for days after reading it, and chills me still. Such memoirs of catastrophic illness are hard to bring off, precisely because the story is so distressingly common. There is the good life lived by the smart but un...</p><h2>American Maps and Mapmakers: Commercial Cartography in the Nineteenth Century</h2><p><p>For map historians and collectors alike intrigued by the geography and history of the United States in the nineteenth century, this gathering of the writings of Walter W, Ristow, handsomely illustrated with over two hundred quality reproductions of maps, charts, panoramic views, and portraits, is a publication not to be missed. Hailed as having "provided the foundation for the study of commercial cartography," Dr. Ristow, former chief of the Geography and Map Division of the Library of Congress, is uniquely qualified to document the origins and development of a truly indigenous style of American cartography. </p><p>Traditionally, the history of American cartography has focused on the discovery, exploration, and colonial periods and on the achievements of European mapmakers. Little is written of the native surveyors, draftsmen, and cartographers who rose to the challenge of supplying maps to a new nation hungry for information about itself. Among the problems that faced the United States were many involving its expansive and often unknown geography, including those as immediate as the determination of the boundaries of each state; without surveying, the Western lands could not be distributed, and the turnpikes, roads, and canals needed to open up the trans-Appalachian territory could not be built. </p><p>Dr. Ristow discusses at length the work of such American cartographers as Abel Buell and John Melish and also the impact of the rise of lithography, which made possible the low-cost map. Among other topics rich in U.S. history are the atlases that supply us with a remarkable record of Victorian America; post-Civil War surveys of the West; charts and guides for navigating coasts and rivers.</p></p><p>For map historians and collectors alike intrigued by the geography and history of the United States in the nineteenth century, this gathering of the writings of Walter W, Ristow, handsomely illustrated with over two hundred quality reproductions of maps,Walter W. Ristow received the Ph.D. degree in geography from Clark University in 1937. He has served as the chief of the Map Division of the New York Public Library and for more than thirty years held administrative positions in the Library of Congress&#39;s Geography and Map Division. Retiring as its chief in 1978, he is presently a consultant in the fields of the history of cartography, map collecting, and map librarianship. Dr. Ristow is the author of the Guide to the History of Cartography and The Emergence of Maps in Libraries and editor of A La Carte: Selected Papers on Maps and Atlases and the facsimile edition of A Survey of the Roads of the United States of America, 1789 by Christopher Colles. He has also written numerous articles. Dr. Ristow was honored in 1979 with the festschrift The Map Librarian in the Modern World: Essays in Honour of Walter W.

Abandoning such conventions as headlines, columns, and even page numbers, the alternative rock-and-roll magazine created a chaotic, abstract style that broke all the rules, clearing the way for a slew of fringe magazines devoted as much to style as to substance. This self-consciously hip, unconventional approach soon emerged on album covers, concert posters, and MTV, signaling the birth of a bona fide movement. The same irreverent approach to production is applied to <i>Ray Gun: Out of Control</i>, forcing you to wade through a maze of random graphics and typefaces to unearth the articles and essays. The search is half the fun, though, as the pieces are enough to capture your interest, even against the backdrop of so much graphic noise.Rick Poyner is the founding editor of Eye, the international review of graphic design.</p><h2>The Cloud of Unknowing</h2><p>Modern rendering of a fourteenth-century classic work of Christian mysticism which describes a soul&#39;s spiritual reunion with God</p><p><b>Ira Progoff</b>&nbsp;(1921&#x2013;1998) worked toward a dynamic humanistic psychology as a private therapist, lecturer, and group leader.

Like them or not, her radical policies made Britain the country it is today. And like her or not, Margaret Thatcher's legacy remains a massive political force, responsible for laying the groundwork for New Labour, Tony Blair, and David Cameron, and for England's strong political allegiance to the United States throughout the Cold War. </p><p>Now Robin Harris, for many years Mrs. Thatcher's speechwriter, close adviser, and the draftsman of both volumes of her autobiography, has written the definitive book about this indomitable English woman. In this international bestseller, he tells the compelling story of her life, from humble beginnings above her father's grocery store in Grantham, her early days as one of the first women in Westminster (she became known as "Thatcher Milk Snatcher" during her time in the Ministry of Education), and then on to her groundbreaking career as Prime Minister (by which time her reputation already demanded a more powerful epithet: "Iron Lady").</p><p>We follow Thatcher through hard-fought political battles and experience with her the tribulations of the English miners' strike and the Falklands War, of her sometimes troubled friendship with Ronald Reagan, and their shared staunch opposition to Communism. We learn of the political intrigue behind the scenes at Ten Downing Street. And how during one of the darkest hours of her premiership she refused to alter course and, adapting the words of an English play, declared to her enemies, inside and outside the Government, "You turn if you want to. The Lady's Not for Turning," summing up for admirers and detractors alike the defiance and consistency of Mrs. Thatcher's approach. Throughout <i>Not for Turning </i>we sense the passionate intellect which fuelled her ambitions, drove her into and out of one of the highest offices in the English-speaking world, and has established a unique political legacy that continues even after her death...</p><p><i>Not for Turning</i> is an unforgettable portrait of Britain's first female Prime Minister, written by one of her most trusted advisers, and a fitting tribute to an extraordinary politician and leader.</p></p><p>ROBIN HARRIS worked for the Conservative Party from 1978, and increasingly closely with Margaret Thatcher herself from 1985, writing her speeches and advising on policy. By the close of her premiership, he was probably the most trusted member of her political team at Downing Street, and he left Number Ten with her. As a member of her personal staff, he then drafted the two volumes of her autobiography and a further book on her behalf, continuing to see her regularly after her retirement.<p>&#x201c;Admiring...but evenhanded--a useful account.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Harris's book...gives us a better glimpse into why and how Thatcher worked so well with Ronald Reagan than I have seen in previous biographies of either.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The American Spectator</i></p><p>&#x201c;The political biography of the decade.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Daily Mail (UK)</i></p><p>&#x201c;[A] lively and accessible insider's account.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Financial Times (UK)</i></p><p>&#x201c;It is refreshing...Harris is like a long-faithful courtier freed by a monarch's death to speak the truth about them.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Guardian (UK)</i></p><p>&#x201c;No-holds-barred, well-written...contains the most authoritative account of her life after leaving office...a dramatic account.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Times (UK)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Readable and well-informed...detailed and fascinating.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Spectator (UK)</i></p><p>&#x201c;A pacy and entertaining book... well-sourced and packed with anecdotes.

Specimen carping takes a specialist approach that sees dedicated anglers going in search of the biggest carp to inhabit lakes, rivers and canals. Once considered a niche following that only appealed to a small hard-core group of fanatics, the popularity of carp fishing has grown - and continues to grow - at a frightening pace. An increasing number of tackle companies, fisheries and tackle shops now base their entire business around carp fishing specialization and the "bug" has spread beyond Britain into the whole of western, central and eastern Europe.

"A white house is fine," said Mr. Pine, "but there are FIFTY white houses all in a line on Vine Street. How can I tell which house is mine?" <p>Mr. Pine had a big problem. But he solved that problem in his own special way. Mr. Pine's Purple House, first published in 1965, was a favorite children's book for many years. When it went out of print fans requested the return of the intrepid Mr. Pine. Well, Mr. Pine is back again, with his dog and his cat, his brushes and ladders, and lots of purple paint!</p></p><p>"Mr. Pine lived on Vine Street in a little white house." That's all fine and dandy, but there are 50 white houses on Vine Street, all in a line, and Mr. Pine can't tell which one is his! To distinguish his own abode, he decides to plant a little pine tree in front, but his neighbors like that idea so much, they do it, too. Even when he plants a bush next to his tree, everyone follows suit. Finally, Mr. Pine paints his house purple--and to his delight, no one else wants a purple house. His neighbors are inspired, however, to paint their own houses all different colors, their first break with conformity. ("'Yellow for me,' said Mrs. Green. 'Green for me,' said Mrs. Brown.") First published in 1965 and out of print until recently, Leonard Kessler's <i>Mr. Pine's Purple House</i>--a story of the triumph of individualism--has crept into the hearts of thousands of readers for decades.

Horwitz offers a sweeping overview of the emergence of a national (and modern) legal system from English and colonial antecedents. He treats the evolution of the common law as intellectual history and also demonstrates how the shifting views of private law became a dynamic element in the economic growth of the United States. </p><p> Horwitz's subtle and sophisticated explanation of societal change begins with the common law, which was intended to provide justice for all. The great breakpoint came after 1790 when the law was slowly transformed to favor economic growth and development. The courts spurred economic competition instead of circumscribing it. This new instrumental law flourished as the legal profession and the mercantile elite forged a mutually beneficial alliance to gain wealth and power. </p><p> The evolving law of the early republic interacted with political philosophy, Horwitz shows. The doctrine of laissez-faire, long considered the cloak for competition, is here seen as a shield for the newly rich. By the 1840s the overarching reach of the doctrine prevented further distribution of wealth and protected entrenched classes by disallowing the courts very much power to intervene in economic life. </p><p> This searching interpretation, which connects law and the courts to the real world, will engage historians in a new debate. For to view the law as an engine of vast economic transformation is to challenge in a stunning way previous interpretations of the eras of revolution and reform. </p></p><p>Awarded the Bancroft Prize in American History in 1978, Morton J. Horwitz&#39;s The Transformation of American Law, 1780-1860 is considered one of the most significant works ever published in American legal history. Since its publication in 1977, it has become the standard source on early nineteenth-century American law. In this monumental book, Morton J. Horwitz offers a sweeping overview of the emergence of our national (and modern) legal system from English and colonial antecedents. He begins with the common law, which emerged during the eighteenth century as the standard doctrine with which to solve disputes in an egalitarian manner. He shows that the turning point in the use of common law came after 1790, when the law was slowly transformed to favor economic growth and development, and the courts began to spur economic competition rather than circumscribe it. This new instrumental law would flourish during the nineteenth century as the legal profession and the mercantile elite forged a mutually beneficial alliance to gain wealth and power. Horwitz also demonstrates how the emergence of contract law corresponded to the development of economic and legal institutions of exchange. And he discusses how the rise of the market economy influenced legal practices, how contracts became ways to negate preexisting common law duties, and how (to the benefit of entrepreneurs and commercial groups) the courts were able to overthrow earlier anticommercial legal rules. Previous historical studies have viewed law and policy as an accurate reflection of the needs of an undifferentiated society. In The Transformation of American Law, Horwitz successfully challenges this misconception and shows how, in theeighty years after the American Revolution, a major change in law took place in which aspects of social struggle turned to legal channels for resolution. Looking into the distribution of wealth and power during this time, Horwitz finds indeed that the change in legal ideology enabled commercial groups to win a disproportionate amount of wealth and power in American society. An accessible account of the history of law, this is a powerful statement on the great role of the legal system in American economic development.<b>Morton J. Horwitz</b> is a graduate of City College of New York and received a doctorate in Government and a law degree from Harvard University.

Ranging from ballet to rock 'n' roll to tribal ritual, from dance immortals like Astaire and Duncan to anonymous participants, the more than 200 plates outline a series of photographic conceptsinvention, record &amp; document, icon &amp; idol, independent eye, collaboration, and tour-de-force. The volume leaves us wanting more. In contrast, Butoh transcends the usual dance book with its fascinating look at a performance art form that combines dance and theater through stark, at times grotesque, visual imagery. Created by avant-garde Japanese dancer Hijikata, butoh is a truly universal dance form at the same time intensely Japanese. Extensive interviews with the late Hijikata and his collaboratorsAshikawa, Ohno, Mishima, and othersare complemented by the highly emotional, thought-provoking, and ultimately shocking images. A unique experience of special interest to dance enthusiasts and photographers. Stephen Allan Patrick, East Tennessee State Univ.

That&#39;s what they told Mary Breydon when she came to manage a rundown stagecoach station on the Cherokee Trail. But Mary had no choice. Her fine Virginia home burned to ashes in the Civil War and her husband was brutally shot down on the way to Colorado. She needed to make a new beginning for herself and her young daughter on the raw frontier. Isolated in an untamed land, their life at the station was achingly hard and they faced the constant danger of attacks by outlaws and marauding Indians. Yet, with the support of a spirited Irish woman, a fearless orphan boy, and, most of all, the mysterious gunman Temple Boone, Mary found the courage to shape her station into a vital stop on America&#39;s westward journey. Until the vicious murderer whose bloody rampages had stained her past suddenly stalked Mary Breydon to Cherokee Station.Louis L&#x2019;Amour is undoubtedly the bestselling frontier novelist of all time.

His life turned upside down when, at age ten, he first heard the Rolling Stones&#x2019; Get Yer Ya-Ya&#x2019;s Out album. By age sixteen, he was chronicling the Stones&#x2019; activities in Beggars Banquet, the fanzine he launched from his bedroom. The band took note and eventually declared Beggars Banquet their official newsletter. German traveled the world with the Stones and was welcomed into their homes. He co-authored The Works with guitarist Ron Wood, and wrote about the group for Rolling Stone and Spin. He&#x2019;s been profiled on MTV and VH1, and has reported on the Stones for various radio stations across the United States, such as WZLX in Boston, KLOS in Los Angeles, WCSX in Detroit, and both WNEW and K-Rock in New York. German majored in journalism at New York University until he dropped out to follow the Stones. He lives in New York City, where he refers to his Manhattan studio apartment as &#x201c;the House the Stones Built.&#x201d;<br><br>www.billgerman.com</p><h2>Three Dollar Mule</h2><p>A boy finds himself the owner of a mule that likes children but is very hostile to adults--to the parents&#39; dismay and the boy&#39;s delight, all attempts to sell the animal fail</p><p></p><h2>Dollhouse Style: Step-by-step Illustarted Guide To Making 90 Authentic Miniatures In 15 Period Styles</h2><p>Devotees of miniature houses and small-scale furnishings will be thrilled with this superb collection of more than 90 dollhouse projects to craft at home.

She lives in Hawaii.THE FAVORED QUEEN (Chapter One)<p>&#x201c;Has she lost her baby?&#x201d;</p><p>My question hung in the air, unanswered.</p><p>The three Spanish midwives, brought from Legrogno especially to attend Queen Catherine at this, her tenth delivery, did not meet my steady gaze but looked down at the thick carpet at their feet. The queen&#x2019;s closest friend and principal lady in waiting, Maria de Salinas, her expression somber and her shoulders rounded in defeat, stood loyally beside her mistress&#x2019;s bed but said nothing. The surgeons who had been summoned by King Henry to attend the queen were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Queen Catherine lay asleep in her high carved wooden bed, mouth agape, her sparse greying auburn hair spread out over her lace-trimmed pillow, the pillow sweat-stained and rumpled as were the bedclothes. Her face was haggard, weary. As those of us who served her knew well, she had been struggling to give birth ever since the previous evening, and it was clear to me now, as I looked down at her, that the effort had taken all her strength. She looked like a woman nearer in age to sixty than forty, though her fortieth birthday had been celebrated by her entire household not long before.</p><p>As I watched, she began to murmur in her sleep, as if troubled by disturbing dreams. Her small white wrinkled hands, the fingers bent and swollen, clutched convulsively at the satin counterpane.</p><p>I glanced around the darkened bedchamber, taking in the closely drawn thick curtains of purple damask, the heavy, old-fashioned furnishings the queen had brought from Spain many years earlier when she came to the English court as a bride, the religious pictures and crucifixes on the paneled walls, the elaborately embroidered prie-dieu, embroidered by the queen herself, where I had so often seen her kneeling in prayer, the implements of torture (as I thought of them) used by the midwives and laid out on a table beside the bed. Knives, probes, metal clamps and pincers. Bowls and towels, powders and flasks full of medicines. Cruel tongs used, I knew, to reach in and grasp a resistant infant trapped inside a diseased womb. I shuddered at the sight of them, and looked away.</p><p>Another sight also made me shudder. A plain wooden chest stood against one wall of the room, its lid not quite closed. Protruding from one corner was a bloody cloth. A sheet, I thought. Hearing me approach, the midwives must have tucked the bloodstained sheets hastily into the chest, and left one corner out.</p><p>The pungent odor of lavender filled the room. Lavender, given to women after childbirth to induce a restful calm and sleep. And there was another odor as well. The sharp, unpleasant odor of opium. I had smelled it often, for my father&#x2019;s physician prescribed it for him to ease the pains of his gout.</p><p>So the queen had been given opium to assuage her labor and to induce the sweat trance believed to lessen the fever that carried off so many women after giving birth. Opium, that helped the mother but often (so I had heard it said) cost the child&#x2019;s life.</p><p>I was still waiting for an answer to my question. There had been a delivery, of that I was certain. But what of the child? We had not heard the cry of the newborn, the joyous shouts of welcome and triumph from the midwives and physicians when the newborn was a boy.</p><p>All was quiet in the room, except for the sound of the queen&#x2019;s ragged breathing. Then I heard a stifled sob. One of the midwives had tears rolling down her olive-tinted cheeks.</p><p>&#x201c;Will no one tell me plainly?&#x201d; I demanded. &#x201c;Has she lost her baby?&#x201d;</p><p>After a pause, Maria de Salinas looked at me and gave the slightest nod.</p><p>&#x201c;He lived for an hour,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Only an hour. He was baptized.&#x201d; At these words Maria and the other women crossed themselves. &#x201c;We prayed,&#x201d; Maria went on. &#x201c;But it was the Lord&#x2019;s will to take him.&#x201d;</p><p>My heart sank. Once more, I thought. Once more, to hope month after long month for a living child, and then to be so cruelly disappointed. I could only imagine the queen&#x2019;s deep sorrow and dismay.</p><p>&#x201c;Has the king been informed?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, Mistress Seymour,&#x201d; Maria answered in her heavily accented English. &#x201c;It was the queen&#x2019;s wish that he not be informed for a little while yet.&#x201d;</p><p>But I had my orders. King Henry had insisted before leaving for the hunt that should the queen&#x2019;s child be born while he was away, a messenger would be sent to him at once. It was my responsibility to follow the royal order.</p><p>I left the bedchamber and sought out Queen Catherine&#x2019;s gentleman usher Griffith Richards, giving him the sad news and instructing him to send word to the king.</p><p>&#x201c;I will go myself, Mistress Seymour,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I know where the huntsmen are today.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ride slowly then,&#x201d; I said softly. &#x201c;The queen is in no hurry to let her husband know what has happened.&#x201d;</p><p>He sighed and nodded. &#x201c;Yet again,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Yet again.&#x201d; He turned and left the room, and I noticed that he did not make haste.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Several hours later Maria de Salinas came to me.</p><p>&#x201c;Mistress Seymour, Her Highness is asking for you.&#x201d;</p><p>I followed her at once into the royal bedchamber where Queen Catherine, out of bed and dressed in a becoming, loose-fitting gown of fine magenta wool trimmed in miniver, was seated before her pier glass.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, Jane,&#x201d; she said as I entered, &#x201c;gentle, kind Jane. Soothe me. Brush out my hair.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Your Majesty.&#x201d;</p><p>I took the soft brush from the dressing table and began to gently run it through the thin strands. I saw the queen&#x2019;s eyes close in pleasure as I did so.</p><p>&#x201c;I must not let the king see me in my tired state. I must try to be pleasant to look at when he comes, when I greet him. After all, he will be tired from his hunt, and in need of refreshment and rest. He will not be in a mood to hear bad news about our child.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;May the Lord bless the little one and take him to His bosom,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Amen,&#x201d; was the queen&#x2019;s soft reply. Her thin lips were curved into a wan smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Another small shrine to be added,&#x201d; she remarked, indicating a cabinet above the prie-dieu where were kept eight miniature portraits, one for each of the children she had lost. Above each portrait was a silver crucifix, below each a tablet with the name of the baby. &#x201c;We had planned to name this one Edward&#x2014;or Isabel, had she been a girl. After my sainted mother.&#x201d;</p><p>Her voice, normally low and pleasant, trembled slightly and she was speaking so softly that it was hard for me to hear her. I felt as though I were listening to someone in a trance. I thought of the opium, the sweat trance&nbsp;... was the queen still under the influence of the strong medicine? She did not seem like herself. Though she often honored me with her confidences, the way she was talking to me now was more open and free than in the past. Almost as if I were her confessor, Fray Diego, and not her maid of honor, Jane Seymour.</p><p>She went on talking, as I brushed the long thin strands of hair and gathered them into my hand. I could not help but notice that the brush was filling with hair; there were thin patches where the queen&#x2019;s scalp all but shone through. What did it mean, that her hair was falling out?</p><p>I looked into the pier glass and saw a slight frown pass across her features. &#x201c;I was so certain that this time&nbsp;... this time&nbsp;... the Lord would give me a strong boy. I made a pilgrimage to Our Lady at her shrine at Walsingham. Afterwards I felt so certain that she would grant my wish.&#x201d;</p><p>I knew well that the queen had made a pilgrimage to the shrine, for I had gone with her. Had she forgotten? Had the opium made her forgetful?</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps she will, Your Majesty. Next time,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>She shook her head. &#x201c;No. I cannot go through such a terrible labor again. No, this was the last time.&#x201d; She made a small sound. I realized that she was laughing quietly to herself.</p><p>&#x201c;My old duenna, Dona Elvira, used to tell me when I was a little girl that I never knew when to give up. I kept on doing the same thing over and over, she said, even though I never got the result I wanted. I guess she was right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your Majesty has been granted a beautiful, intelligent daughter, Princess Mary. Your jewel and delight, as you always say.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. But she is not a prince. And England needs a prince.&#x201d;</p><p>I had nothing to say to that, so was silent. Everyone knew the situation, the problem&#x2014;many called it a crisis&#x2014;over the succession. King Henry needed a son to inherit his throne. But he had only a daughter, only Princess Mary, who had been given the title Princess of Wales, the title traditionally given to the officially designated heir, but who could not be expected to reign. No woman could govern the unruly English, that was evident to all. The chronicles told of a queen in the distant past, Queen Maud, who attempted to rule but was overthrown. No woman had tried since. Better the throne should pass to the king&#x2019;s natural son, the boy known as Henry Fitzroy. But should he be the one to inherit, there would be challenges to his rulership. There would be chaos, possibly civil war, as in the time of King Henry&#x2019;s grandfather.</p><p>So the king&#x2019;s loyal subjects prayed that the queen, despite her many failures in the past, would at last give birth to a healthy boy. But those prayers&#x2014;including my own&#x2014;had gone unanswered.</p><p>Presently I said, &#x201c;Shall I bind Your Majesty&#x2019;s hair?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Jane. And put on my hood, the cheerful rose-colored one with the pearls.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That one is very becoming.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It brings a little color to these pale cheeks. Henry complains that I am too sallow. And then, Jane, it will be time to bring in the other ladies and the maids of honor. I must tell them my news myself.&#x201d;</p><p>I did my best to complete the queen&#x2019;s coiffure&#x2014;normally the task of her hairdressers&#x2014;and to put her hood in place. Together we regarded her image in the pier glass. She smiled. She had come out of her trance. Once again she was the serene, gracious royal wife, head of her extensive household. The signs of her recent ordeal were there to be seen, in her drawn features and the dark circles under her eyes, but her manner was more confident.</p><p>&#x201c;Please tell Maria that I am ready. And send Fray Diego to me, to hear my confession.&#x201d;</p><p>Her confession, I thought. What had she to confess? Surely bearing another stillborn child after undergoing many hours of heroic labor was no sin? Or did she imagine that the death of her child was a divine punishment?</p><p>I went out through the antechamber and into the room where the ladies in waiting and maids of honor were assembled.</p><p>&#x201c;She is ready,&#x201d; I told Maria de Salinas. &#x201c;She asks for Fray Diego, to make her confession, and then she will speak to us all.&#x201d;</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>I remember so well what happened later that afternoon. We had all taken our places in a reverent circle around the queen&#x2019;s chair, where she sat in benevolent calm. There were her Spanish ladies, Maria de Salinas, Ines de Venegas, Francesca de Lima and others whose names I barely knew, not having occasion to speak with them or perform tasks alongside them. And there were the chief officers of her household, and her chaplains and confessor. And then there were the women I knew best, the ladies in waiting and, especially, the other maids of honor.</p><p>There were nine of us, as I remember, and we were a widely varied lot. First came Anne Cavecant, Lord Cavecant&#x2019;s daughter and the oldest among us, ashamed of her looks (she was rather homely, with a long sharp nose and pockmarked skin and a shy, almost furtive expression) and even more ashamed that, at twenty-seven, she was still without a husband. It was said that she had once been chosen by an elderly knight to become his fourth wife, but he had died before the wedding ceremony could take place. Since then she had waited in vain for another man to choose her.</p><p>Lavinia Terling was sly and pretty with hair that fell in long blond waves and innocent-looking blue eyes, a well-behaved girl but with only one thought in her head: how soon would she marry, and how rich and highborn would her husband be? The Belgian among us, Jane Popyngcort, insisted upon dressing in the foreign style rather than wearing English gowns and hoods. She was said to have been King Henry&#x2019;s mistress when both were young, and this gave her a certain air of mystery. (&#x201c;Though she didn&#x2019;t last,&#x201d; the other maids said behind Jane&#x2019;s back. &#x201c;She couldn&#x2019;t have mattered very much to him.&#x201d;)</p><p>Of the remaining maids, the ones who stood out most were Bridget Wiltshire, small and feral and as lean as a greyhound, and with a sharp tongue and a quick wit, who had just become engaged to Lord Wingfield, and her close friend Anne Boleyn, the temperamental dark-haired, dark-eyed sister of the king&#x2019;s mistress Mary Boleyn Carey whose name we were not allowed to mention in the queen&#x2019;s presence. Anne, so it was said, was well beyond the age when a gentleman&#x2019;s daughter (and the niece of the powerful Duke of Norfolk) ought to be married, and although she had had at least three chances for a match, none of them had resulted in a betrothal.</p><p>I was the youngest of the maids of honor, but&#x2014;I am not being immodest, merely telling the truth&#x2014;I believe that, among the English women in Queen Catherine&#x2019;s household, I was the most favored by her. She liked having me near her, especially when upsetting events were challenging her usual calm and self-possession. There were many such challenges in those years, when I first came to court. Naturally her Spanish ladies resented the favoritism she showed me, believing that since they shared her native speech and customs, they should be the ones to be kept nearest her person. I was well aware of this resentment and did what I could to lower it. But I knew that Maria de Salinas and the others regarded me as a presumptuous intruder in their midst, and imagined that I had risen to favor with the queen through trickery or by slandering them, whereas in fact I had merely been myself.</p><p>The queen was preparing to speak. There was quiet in the room; even Bridget and Anne, whose giggles and titters were forever interrupting solemn occasions, were silent for the moment.</p><p>All eyes were on Catherine. Then, with a sweet and gracious smile, she addressed us.</p><p>&#x201c;By now you all know that the Lord has not seen fit to bless this kingdom with a male heir to the throne. My son, Edward, did not live to take his first breath.&#x201d;</p><p>Polite murmurs of consolation greeted these words. The queen acknowledged them with a small nod, then went on.</p><p>&#x201c;Our prayers are not always answered as we would wish, as Fray Diego reminds me. The Lord&#x2019;s purposes are not ours. But then, it is not our bodies, or their fruits, that matter, it is our eternal souls. As we read in the gospel, they should not be feared which have the power of the body, but Him only, that hath power over the soul.</p><p>&#x201c;I have been shriven,&#x201d; the queen went on, &#x201c;and will be churched in due course. Until then I will keep my chamber, and will expect you all to say little of what has passed here in recent days.

Ron Hubbard is among the most acclaimed and widely read authors of our time. As a leading light of American Pulp Fiction through the 1930s and '40s, he is further among the most influential authors of the modern age. Indeed, from Ray Bradbury to Stephen King, there is scarcely a master of imaginative tales who has not paid tribute to L. Ron Hubbard.</p><br>The comic nightmare continues in book six of Hubbard's 10-volume broadside, Mission Earth. Our Dudley Do-Right hero, Jettero Heller, is having trouble starting his Everglades launching pad for the spores that will clean up atmospheric pollution. To aid him, his fiancee, Countess Krak, fakes evidence certifying him as an illegitimate son of oil baron Delbert John Rockecenter, the world's wealthiest and most powerful man. Meanwhile, Heller's nemesis, the ineffectual spy chief Soltan Gris, makes another series of attempts to end Heller's good deeds. Gris first hires a hitmanwho is killed by his own mother. Next he has his PR man go in for character assassination, and finally he files false lawsuits and criminal charges against Heller, which sends the police after him. This is every bit as tedious and heavy-handed as the first five volumes but will no doubt join them on the bestseller list. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Handbook of Natural Beauty</h2><p>Describes homemade cosmetic preparations for the skin, hair, eyes, teeth, and nails, and discusses the benefits of exercise and diet in maintaining general physical well-being</p><p></p><h2>What If You Met a Knight?</h2><p><br><br>Forget jousts and quests and dragons--a real knight had real work to do, lots of mouths to feed, and trouble could ride over the hill at any moment. Castles were dark, armor was uncomfortable, and jousts and tournaments (not to mention real battles) were dangerous--and expensive. As in the popular and successful What If You Met a Pirate? an informative, entertaining text and energetic illustrations, diagrams, and cross sections combine to explore a subject with loads of kid appeal.<br><br></p><p><br><br>Jan Adkins, called "the consummate teacher" by David Macaulay, is the author and illustrator of more than three dozen books covering history, technology, and many other topics. They include Bridges: From My Side to Yours ("An outstanding book for reference and enjoyment"--The Horn Book) and What If You Met a Pirate? (see page 30). Jan Adkins lives in Novato, California.<br><br>Grade 4-8&#x2013;Adkins debunks the romantic ideas about knights and chooses to show the real deal, instead. He starts with Arthur and the Round Table, explaining how troubadours and storytellers spread pretty tales that had little basis in reality. He explains the feudal system and describes the life of Sir Guy of Wareham, who spent his days running his large farm. He served as a merchant, a banker, and even as the local judge, and was responsible for the health and safety of not only his wife and children, but also all of the peasants who lived on his land and worked for him. Using a question-and-answer format, Adkins holds readers interest by including details that humanize the information. While the approach is inviting and the narrative is lively and full of facts, the format may be a bit off-putting. The main text is in a standard-size font, but a great deal of additional material is in much smaller, captionlike paragraphs. The illustrations are numerous, intricate, and beautifully rendered, but smallish. Although most of the depictions are innocuous, one shows a beheading by sword. An excellent extended-reading resource and a good choice for children interested in the period.<i>&#x2013;Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christophers School, Richmond, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Outside the glowing warmth of the birthing barn, night pressed icy black fingers against the windows, and snow lay thick on the ground.<br><br> Exhausted but triumphant, Dr. Lily Munroe tried to ignore the itchy, someone-was-watching-her sensation on the back of her neck, a creepy feeling she&#x2019;d had off and on for several hours. She patted the cow&#x2019;s russet-colored rump. &#x201c;You have a beautiful bouncing baby boy. Good job, Peaches.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Peaches?&#x201d; a familiar husky voice said behind her. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not a pet, Doc.&#x201d;<br><br> The straw at her feet rustled as Lily whirled around, hand to her throat. &#x201c;Damn it! You scared me to death!&#x201d;<br><br> Tall, dark and annoying.<br><br> Derek Wright.<br><br> With one shoulder resting against the planked wall, he looked as though he&#x2019;d been there awhile. His physical presence was like a hard punch to Lily&#x2019;s chest, and her stomach did its usual betraying flip-flop at the sight of six foot four inches of pure, potent male. His lean, handsome face was ruddy with the cold, his glossy dark hair mussed sexily by the wind she heard howling outside.<br><br> Beneath her fingertips she felt the hard pounding of her heart, and hoped to hell Derek couldn&#x2019;t hear it. And if he could that he&#x2019;d attribute it to the fright he&#x2019;d just given her. The adrenaline rush made her feel light-headed. She ruthlessly tamped down her body&#x2019;s visceral reaction to the sight of him as she started cleaning up her instruments and other birthing paraphernalia from around the stall.<br><br> &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he said, voice silky. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t mean to spook you.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t look the least bit sorry, and she shot him a dark look. His lips twitched. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re hell on a man&#x2019;s ego, Doc.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with your ego. It&#x2019;s healthy as a horse,&#x201d; Lily told him. The breathless, heart-stopping feeling would fade if she took deep breaths and got a grip. &#x201c;Maybe you should wear a bell around your neck when you skulk. Or whistle. Or stomp or something.&#x201d; She bent to pick up the obstetrical handles and chains she&#x2019;d used earlier and sealed them in a bag to sterilize later.<br><br> &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t skulking. I was waiting for you to finish what you were doing so I didn&#x2019;t distract you.&#x201d;<br><br> Oh, he distracted her, all right, but she wasn&#x2019;t going to give him the satisfaction of knowing it. Had it been the subconscious awareness of Derek watching her that she&#x2019;d felt for the last few hours? She couldn&#x2019;t imagine him staying quiet for that long. She met his eyes. Zing went the strings of her heart. She wished her heart and brain would get into sync.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have you know I have a reputation for being very light on my feet,&#x201d; he told her, suave as always. His dark blue eyes twinkled beneath midnight brows.<br><br> &#x201c;Have to be to sneak out of all those bedrooms, huh?&#x201d;<br><br> He shook his head and smiled. A smile, Lily noticed, that didn&#x2019;t quite reach his eyes. &#x201c;No sneaking. No bedrooms. I dance like Fred Astaire,&#x201d; he told her immodestly.<br><br> He probably did. For such a big man he did move with surprising grace. &#x201c;Good for you. Could you dance back a bit? You&#x2019;re spooking Peaches and the baby.&#x201d;<br><br> They both looked at the cow and calf. Neither had noticed the two humans invading their space. Derek gave her a slow, assessing look. &#x201c;Feeling crowded, Doc?&#x201d; One corner of his mouth lifted and Lily told herself to ignore his sex appeal.<br><br> He always made her want to fidget. With her hair. Her clothes. Her personality. Everything about Derek was attractive. Exciting. Larger than life. Being around him made her feel like a small brown bird. He was Technicolor. She was sepia.<br><br> Nothing wrong with sepia, she told herself firmly, annoyed that she felt this way when she was around him, and not quite sure how to fix it.<br><br> &#x201c;I always feel crowded around you,&#x201d; she told him honestly, tossing a spare pair of surgical gloves back into her bag. She resisted his charm with the same determination she&#x2019;d used for years. It wasn&#x2019;t easy. She felt his pull. Her tide to his moon. Which was fanciful nonsense. Her hormones misbehaved because he was a hottie. Chemistry. Nothing more.<br><br> &#x201c;Why is that, I wonder?&#x201d; he asked softly. His voice always reminded Lily of dark chocolate. It was smooth, rich and had a slight huskiness to it that abraded her nerve endings like a cat&#x2019;s tongue.<br><br> She straightened and gave him a firm look. &#x201c;Give it a rest, would you? I&#x2019;m not up to your sparring weight tonight. I&#x2019;m exhausted, hungry and absolutely filthy. If you want to flirt with someone, go inside and make a call.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s midnight.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Poor baby.&#x201d; She bent to pick up her jacket, then gave it a good shake and hung it over the rail. &#x201c;All your lady friends turned into pumpkins?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Might as well have,&#x201d; he groused.<br><br> Lily shook her head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re incorrigible.&#x201d; And charming, and funny and unhealthily appealing.<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the baby&#x2019;s name?&#x201d; Derek asked, white teeth flashing. He always teased her about naming the animals. He seemed to enjoy teasing her, period. He also seemed to know exactly how far he could push her, and then he&#x2019;d cleverly back off. Devious man. &#x201c;Pit?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Brad.&#x201d;<br><br> He smiled, and not being made of stone, Lily smiled back. &#x201c;Only you would name a potential prize-winning bull after a movie star.&#x201d;<br><br> He got it. Of course he did. Lily bit back a sigh as her smile faded. Unlike her husband, Derek had a wicked sense of humor, and an agile and clever mind behind that handsome face. All of which made resisting him damn difficult. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a talent,&#x201d; she told him modestly, turning back to her task of tidying up. &#x201c;What can I say?&#x201d;<br><br> Tucking her T-shirt hem back into her jeans as she straightened up, Lily wondered if resisting him would become easier over the years, or if it would always be such hard work.<br><br> Still, he was a pleasure to look at. No matter what the circumstances, he appeared darkly elegant and cultured. And tonight was no exception. As always he was appropriately dressed for tromping in the barn on a cold winter&#x2019;s night. Jeans, boots, and a thick, cream-colored wool turtleneck under a bulky shearling jacket. Appropriately dressed, but somehow looking as though he&#x2019;d stepped out of the glossy pages of a men&#x2019;s magazine.<br><br> Conscious of her gunk-covered jeans, shit-covered boots and sweaty face, Lily forced her hands not to fiddle with her God-only-knew-what-was-in-it hair. &#x201c;How long were you standing there, anyway?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Couple of minutes. Need a hand?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m good, thanks.&#x201d; What she was, was sweaty, filthy and worried. They needed to talk, and talk soon. But a woman needed to be at her sharpest to match wits with Derek. And Lily wasn&#x2019;t nearly up to locking horns with her partner tonight. On either a personal or business level.<br><br> Besides, she needed to have all her facts together before confronting him, and damn it, she wanted to pick the time and the place. He made her jumpier than anyone she&#x2019;d ever known, including her late, unlamented husband, and she was sure he did it on purpose.<br><br> His tone changed as he said softly, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re skittish tonight.&#x201d;<br><br> The man was way too observant. Her instincts around him had always been primitive; Lily felt the need to raise the drawbridge, man the battle stations and drag out the big guns. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not skittish,&#x201d; she lied. &#x201c;Just tired. Peaches and I have been at this for sixteen hours.&#x201d;<br><br> He gave her an assessing look that made her blood feel as effervescent as champagne as it zipped through her veins. &#x201c;You look good tired.&#x201d;<br><br> She snorted and shook her head. He really was incorrigible. &#x201c;Sure. And wearing Eau de Bovine is downright tantalizing, too.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;On you, yeah.&#x201d;<br><br> She huffed out an amused breath and crossed her arms, then, realizing her body language practically shouted that he made her nervous, uncrossed them and stuffed her hands into the deep pockets of her rubber apron. He didn&#x2019;t need to know he made her feel a little like a rabbit squaring off against a cobra: scared, but fascinated nevertheless. She cocked her head as she looked at him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re wearing an earring.&#x201d;<br><br> A small sapphire glinted in his left earlobe. It made him look like a chic pirate. The dark hair brushing his collar did nothing to soften his face. His eyes were a dark, almost navy blue, and thickly screened by black lashes. His mouth was frankly sensual and he had a playbill of smiles for every occasion. This one was both mocking and enigmatic and, annoyingly as hell, sent a fresh shiver down her spine. &#x201c;Like it?&#x201d;<br><br> She shrugged; what she&#x2019;d like was to nibble it right off his ear. Absolutely disgusted with herself, Lily scowled. For pity&#x2019;s sake, just how tired was she? &#x201c;Not many ranchers I know wear gemstones,&#x201d; she mocked. &#x201c;Not the guys anyway.&#x201d;<br><br> His chuckle, low, throaty and filled with implications that had nothing to do with the conversation, made Lily&#x2019;s mouth go dry. &#x201c;Are you casting aspersions on my masculinity?&#x201d;<br><br> Not just no, Lily thought, but hell no. Derek Wright was all man. He had a magnetic personality, and men and women alike were drawn to him. The earring would make him even more attractive. Women made fools of themselves over him already. He was wickedly attractive, wealthy and charming. And he burned with a smoldering sensuality that had females turning to mush at the mere sight of him.<br><br> All it took was a certain look, a suggested arch of his eyebrow and a crook of his finger, and susceptible women with no sense, no self-restraint and no willpower fell at his feet like puppies waiting for their bellies to be rubbed.<br><br> Like Sean, Derek was a high-maintenance guy.<br><br> No thanks. Been there, done that.<br><br> The trick was to keep him at arm&#x2019;s length at all cost. &#x201c;What are you doing here anyway?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I live here,&#x201d; he told her mildly.<br><br> The original ranch house where Derek lived was a hundred feet away. The ostentatious house Sean had had built for their marriage was five miles away. The ranch house had charm and character. Her house had expensive things. She&#x2019;d switch any day.<br><br> &#x201c;Here, in the barn, at midnight,&#x201d; Lily said patiently.<br><br> &#x201c;Sounds like a song.&#x201d; He smiled charmingly when she arched a brow. &#x201c;Okay, okay. To see you.&#x201d;<br><br> Lily yanked on the tap and waited for the water to get warm before scrubbing her clean hands . . . cleaner. She glanced at him over her shoulder. &#x201c;I thought you were in New York seeing that new Neil Simon play with what&#x2019;s her name.&#x201d; Derek liked, actually enjoyed opera, the theater and even ballet. He also liked sports and country music. Mostly, though, he liked women. He was a dangerous man.<br><br> &#x201c;Christine. I was. We did. Flew back an hour ago.&#x201d;<br><br> How many men flew to New York for the night just to catch a play? A man with way too many sides to his personality. And a different lady friend for every activity, too. Which is why Lily tried her damnedest to keep some distance between them. Usually she succeeded. Clearly, Derek wasn&#x2019;t going away, so stalling the much-needed conversation wasn&#x2019;t going to help her any.<br><br> She was in no shape to be doing this now, she warned herself. But if not now&#x2014;when? Might as well get the small bone of contention out on the table and over with. The other, major one could wait until she&#x2019;d armed herself with facts and figures.<br><br> &#x201c;I had an illuminating conversation with Angie Blaylock yesterday,&#x201d; Lily said casually as she looked around for something to dry her hands on. Angie was an ex of Derek&#x2019;s and the personal assistant to the town attorney, Barry Campbell.<br><br> &#x201c;Sweetheart, if you want to hear about my love life, come to me directly.&#x201d; The words were spoken as much with his eyes as his voice. His smile was lazy and more than a little arrogant as he finished smoothly, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be happy to te&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> A woman could drown in those somnolent blue eyes&#x2014; She blew out an exasperated breath. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be an ass.&#x201d; It made her insane the way he flirted with her. As if he needed the practice. &#x201c;Angie told me you deeded half the Flying F to Sean three years ago when he was diagnosed as terminal. Is that true?&#x201d; Lily&#x2019;s skin felt hot and tight with equal parts embarrassment and annoyance. Damn you, Sean. How could you?<br><br> Derek tossed her a towel. &#x201c;So much for client confiden- tiality.&#x201d;<br><br> His flippancy made her hackles rise. &#x201c;Damn it.&#x201d; She dried her hands and watched as the calf, after several unsuccessful tries, wobbled to his feet and started rooting for nutrition.<br><br> She straightened, meeting his gaze again unflinchingly. God, she didn&#x2019;t do confrontation well. Unfortunately it was one of Derek&#x2019;s stock-in-trades. &#x201c;For once be serious. Is it true?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What if it is?&#x201d;<br><br> Lily counted to ten, then eleven, then gave it up. &#x201c;The only way you could have given Sean half was if you had the whole to start with. I thought you were equal partners.&#x201d; She shoved her hair out of her face. She needed to cut her bangs.<br><br> What a hell of a mess Sean had left her. One more lie, she thought. Stacked onto the mountains of lies her husband had spent his life building. And millions of dollars changing hands like playing cards was just one portion of the current mess that still had to be addressed.<br><br> &#x201c;I own half. You own half. What&#x2019;s the big deal?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sean told me&#x2014; No, never mind.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sean told you what?&#x201d;<br><br> He might have been a liar and a cheat, but Sean had been passionate about his family&#x2019;s ranch. &#x201c;He was embarrassed that he had to bring you in to help with the financial aspect of buying the ranch.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That works for me. Let&#x2019;s leave it at that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not true.&#x201d; She knew it wasn&#x2019;t. Down to her bones, she knew Sean had lied. If the truth would have helped, he&#x2019;d still have fabricated some wild story that made him either the hero or the victim.<br><br> &#x201c;What do you want me to say, Lily? That I bought the ranch six years ago and let Sean claim ownership?&#x201d; Derek shrugged broad shoulders. &#x201c;Made no damn difference to me, and it made him happy. What was the harm? Half the Flying F is yours. That was always the plan.&#x201d;<br><br> Whose plan? Sean&#x2019;s? Lily would like to believe her husband had been that far-seeing, but it was pretty damn hard to swallow. Hence the name the Flying F. A finger to his dead father, who&#x2019;d let the ranch go to hell in a handbasket rather than leave it to his only child. She shot a look at Derek. &#x201c;Then why&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Jesus, Lily.&#x201d; His eyes flashed and his mouth went tight. &#x201c;Who cares, for God&#x2019;s sake? No one. Let it go. What difference does it make in the grand scheme of things how it came about? None. Sean and I both wanted you to own half the spread. It&#x2019;s a done deal. Live with it.&#x201d;<br><br> Fighting back waves of fatigue, Lily stiffened, and gave him a glare equivalent to pitchforking him to the wall. &#x201c;You might be used to giving orders that everyone jumps to obey, but news flash, Ace: I&#x2019;m not one of your employees. I don&#x2019;t jump when you say jump.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t I know it,&#x201d; he said ruefully. He gave her a studied look. &#x201c;Then fight me for the other half, and boot my ass out.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That does have a perverse appeal,&#x201d; Lily told him. &#x201c;Thank you, but no thank you.&#x201d; She leaned her butt against the sink and stuffed her fingers in her front pockets as she watched him prowl around the stall.<br><br> Peaches mooed as he walked around her to pick up a couple of small wood figurines sitting on a post. &#x201c;These are incredible.&#x201d; His long fingers caressed the detail in her three-inch-high carving of Diablo.<br><br> She shrugged, ridiculously pleased, and acutely aware of the way his thumb moved in almost a caress over the wooden bull as he turned the carving in his hand. It was so like him to home in on the one thing she was most proud of and neatly change the subject.<br><br> &#x201c;Just something to while a...</p><h2>Beeline: What Spelling Bees Reveal About Generation Z&#39;s New Path to Success</h2><p><b>An anthropologist uses spelling bees as a lens to examine the unique and diverse traits of Generation Z--and why they are destined for success<br></b><br>At first glance, Generation Z (youth born after 1997) seems to be made up of anxious overachievers, hounded by Tiger Moms and constantly tracked on social media. One would think that competitors in the National Spelling Bee -- the most popular brain sport in America -- would be the worst off. Counterintuitively, anthropologist Shalini Shankar argues that, far from being simply overstressed and overscheduled, Gen Z spelling bee competitors are learning crucial twenty-first-century skills from their high-powered lives, displaying a sophisticated understanding of self-promotion, self-direction, and social mobility. Drawing on original ethnographic research, including interviews with participants, judges, and parents, Shankar examines the outsize impact of immigrant parents and explains why Gen Z kids are on a path to success.</p><p><b>Shalini Shankar</b> is professor of anthropology and Asian American studies at Northwestern University. A Guggenheim fellow and National Science Foundation grant recipient, she is the mother of two Gen Z children. Shankar splits her time between Evanston, Illinois, and Brooklyn, New York."In this engaging book, Shalini Shankar tells the story of the extraordinary kids who participate in competitive spelling bees, and through them, in turn, the story of Generation Z. Shankar shows us how these kids become entrepreneurs of their own lives, and do it with amazing discipline, poise, and good spirit."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Sherry Ortner, Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at UCLA</b></i></b><br><br>"Fascinating. Shalini Shankar uses the spelling bee as a lens into the world of Gen Z, illuminating its contours and giving us all a chance to reflect on what it means to grow up." <br>&#x2015;<b><i><b>Angela Duckworth, author of <i>Grit</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Spelling stichomythia or gesellschaft in front of a television audience of millions isn't just about hundreds of hours of study and dedication. As Shalini Shankar's exploration of the culture of spelling bees shows, the orthographic feats of a handful of driven children reflect much more -- about intellectual competition, the immigrant experience, and the pursuit of success in modern America."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Stefan Fatsis, author of <i>Word Freak: Heartbreak, Triumph, Genius, and Obsession in the World of Competitive Scrabble Players</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Shalini Shankar does a remarkable job of pulling back the curtain on the phenomenon of 'spelling bee kids.' With the careful eye of an ethnographer, she takes the reader behind the scenes to understand the cultural world of elite spellers who learn to master not just the dictionary but the complex terrain of 'brain sports.'

Most of her characters appear to be Southerners--occasionally verging on Faulknerian caricatures--and Holland upholds the region's tradition with tales that contain some fairly gothic behavior. In ``Absolution'' a woman who has been crowned banana queen describes her relationships with her lover (``he ain't the hitching kind'') and her mother, who ``sometimes...wants my mouth on her breast, like when I was her child.'' A man shaves off all of his bedridden wife's body hair in ``Winter Bodies''; the waitress narrator of ``Delicious'' sees a customer chew all of his food, then remove it from his mouth and replace it on his plate. There's a great deal of illness and dying, as well, most of it slow and painful. A talkative man loses his ability to speak after a car accident in ``The Change in Union City.'' Being hand-fed Ethiopian food triggers memories of feeding an elderly father for the narrator of ``Amharic.'' The lengthy and problematic story ``Orbit,'' which shows a brother and sister caring for their sick mother to the best of their abilities after their father leaves, brings out the best and the worst in Holland's writing. It contains wonderful images--attempting to coerce captured turtles from their shells, the siblings ``try to pry them out with kitchen knives and pliers, to burn them out with candles, mute things, toothless''-- but in the end they pile up without connecting much, and it becomes difficult to locate the narrative within all the symbolism. An intriguing new voice, at the moment a little too enamored of showy cadenzas and neglectful of basic melody. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Strange, glittering, incantatory language marks Holland's debut short-fiction collection. These odd, occasionally impenetrable pieces were not written for narrative addicts; though certain events do occur, they are seen only hazily through a mesmerizing--and sometimes fustian--web of words and style. In "Orbit," a brother and sister offer alternating impressionistic accounts of the summer when their father abandoned their dying mother, leaving them alone on the family farm. Looping, cadenced sentences ("I did not have shoes. I did not have Bingo with me going there or coming back, and coming back I came by foot and I did not have shoes.") convey the anarchic rhythms of this macabre idyll. "Delicious," a disturbing exploration of the undercurrents of--among other things--the relationship between a waitress and a restaurant customer, is narrated almost entirely in wickedly accurate restaurant lingo. The brief but chilling "Winter Bodies" concerns a ritual act--possibly a highly personal sort of last rite--carried out by a man upon the drugged-out and/or diseased body of his lover. "The Change in Union City," one of the collection's more accessible stories, is the chronicle of the declining fortunes of a small town and its most colorful, vital inhabitant. If they can get past the gothic excess, sophisticated readers will enjoy the challenge of these provocative, nearly hypnotic stories. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Life After Death: A History of the Afterlife in Western Religion</h2><p>A magisterial work of social history, <i>Life After Death</i> illuminates the many different ways ancient civilizations grappled with the question of what exactly happens to us after we die.<br><br>In a masterful exploration of how Western civilizations have defined the afterlife, Alan F. Segal weaves together biblical and literary scholarship, sociology, history, and philosophy. A renowned scholar, Segal examines the maps of the afterlife found in Western religious texts and reveals not only what various cultures believed but how their notions reflected their societies&#x2019; realities and ideals, and why those beliefs changed over time. He maintains that the afterlife is the mirror in which a society arranges its concept of the self. The composition process for&nbsp;Judaism, Christianity, and Islam&nbsp;begins in grief and ends in the victory of the self over death.<br><br>Arguing that in every religious tradition the afterlife represents the ultimate reward for the good, Segal combines historical and anthropological data with insights gleaned from religious and philosophical writings to explain the following mysteries: why the Egyptians insisted on an afterlife in heaven, while the body was embalmed in a tomb on earth; why the Babylonians viewed the dead as living in underground prisons; why the Hebrews remained silent about life after death during the period of the First Temple, yet embraced it<b> </b>in the Second Temple period (534 B.C.E. &#x2013;70 C.E.); and why Christianity placed the afterlife in the center of its belief system. He discusses the inner dialogues and arguments within Judaism and Christianity, showing the underlying dynamic behind them, as well as the ideas that mark the differences between the two religions. In a thoughtful examination of the influence of biblical views of heaven and martyrdom on Islamic beliefs, he offers a fascinating perspective on the current troubling rise of Islamic fundamentalism.<br><br>In tracing the organic, historical relationships between sacred texts and communities of belief and comparing the visions of life after death that have emerged throughout history, Segal sheds a bright, revealing light on the intimate connections between notions of the afterlife, the societies that produced them, and the individual&#x2019;s search for the ultimate meaning of life on earth.</p><p>ALAN F. SEGAL is Professor of Religion and Ingeborg Rennert Professor of Jewish Studies at Barnard College, Columbia University. He is the author of <i>Paul the Convert</i>, <i>Rebecca&#x2019;s Children</i>, and <i>Two Powers in Heaven</i>, as well as numerous scholarly articles.This monumental study combines history, geography, mythology, archaeology and anthropology with biblical text analysis. Segal, a professor of Jewish studies at Barnard College, spent 10 years on this project, but the erudition he displays is undoubtedly the result of a lifetime of scholarship. In every culture, people ask the same fundamental questions about their existence, including "what happens after we die?" Although Segal maintains that answers to that question lie "beyond confirmation or disconfirmation in the scientific sense," he offers a comprehensive overview of how the afterlife is understood in the three main Western religions. He thoroughly examines early influences from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Canaan, Iran and Greece, then analyzes Jewish views as expressed in the first and second temple periods, the book of Daniel, the Dead Sea scrolls and writings from and about New Testament times, the early rabbis, mysticism and fundamentalism. For Christianity, systematic attention is given to Paul, the Gospels, the pseudepigraphic literature and the Church Fathers. Segal also scans Muslim beliefs as they appear in the Qur'an and the writings of Shi'a mystics and modern fundamentalists. The introductory and concluding chapters provide the essence of the presentation, enlivened by quotations from Shakespeare. Impatient readers may begin with these two chapters as a guide to determining which other sections of the book warrant further scrutiny. Careful readers, however, will take the trouble and the time to pore over this impressive contribution to our understanding of human belief and behavior. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Initially published as a much-abridged serial, the text first appeared in its full and present form in 1895.In 1895 Hardy's final novel, the great tale of <i>Jude The Obscure</i>, sent shockwaves of indignation rolling across Victorian England. Hardy had dared to write frankly about sexuality and to indict the institutions of marriage, education, and religion. But he had, in fact, created a deeply moral work. The stonemason Jude Fawley is a dreamer; his is a tragedy of unfulfilled aims. With his tantalizing cousin Sue Bridehead, the last and most extraordinary of Hardy's heroines, Jude takes on the world--and discovers, tragically, its brutal indifference. The most powerful expression of Hardy's philosophy, and a profound exploration of man's essential loneliness, <i>Jude The Obscure</i> is a great and beautiful book.

The practice officially dates back to Gregor Mendel -- who was not a renowned scientist, but a 19th century Augustinian monk. Mendel spent many hours toiling in his garden, testing and cultivating more than 28,000 pea plants, selectively determining very specific characteristics of the peas that were produced, ultimately giving birth to the idea of heredity -- and the now very common practice of artificially modifying our food.</p> <p>But as science takes the helm, steering common field practices into the laboratory, the world is now keenly aware of how adept we have become at tinkering with nature --which in turn has produced a variety of questions. Are genetically modified foods really safe? Will the foods ultimately make us sick, perhaps in ways we can't even imagine? Isn't it genuinely dangerous to change the nature of nature itself?</p> <p>Nina Fedoroff, a leading geneticist and recognized expert in biotechnology, answers these questions, and more. Addressing the fear and mistrust that is rapidly spreading, Federoff and her co-author, science writer Nancy Brown, weave a narrative rich in history, technology, and science to dispel myths and misunderstandings.</p> <p>In the end, Fedoroff arues, plant biotechnology can help us to become better stewards of the earth while permitting us to feed ourselves and generations of children to come.

McClellan and other generals, and the anxiety preceding the Merrimack&#x2019;s epic battle with the Monitor. &nbsp;In 1866 Stoddard also penned thirteen &#x201c;White House Sketches&#x201d; about his time in Lincoln&#x2019;s service.

Brown, a Fugitive Slave / Clotel; or, the President's / American Fugitive ... My Southern Home / (Library of America, 247)</h2><p>Born a slave and kept functionally illiterate until he escaped at age nineteen, William Wells Brown (1814&#x2013;1884) refashioned himself first as an agent of the Underground Railroad, then as an antislavery activist and self-taught orator, and finally as the author of a series of landmark works that made him, like Frederick Douglass, a foundational figure of African American literature. His controversial novel <i>Clotel; or, the President&#x2019;s Daughter </i>(1853), a fictionalized account of the lives and struggles of Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s black daughters and granddaughters, is the first novel written by an African American.

However, none satisfactorily explain why the Japanese lost that battle, given their overwhelming advantage in firepower. While no book may ever silence debate on the subject, Midway Inquest answers the central mystery of the battle. Why could the Japanese not get a bomber strike launched against the American carrier force before being attacked and destroyed by American dive bombers from the Enterprise and Yorktown? Although it is well known that the Japanese were unable to launch an immediate attack because their aircraft were in the process of changing armament, why wasn&#x2019;t the rearming operation reversed and an attack launched before the American planes arrived? Based on extensive research in Japanese primary records, Japanese literature on the battle, and interviews with over two dozen Japanese veterans from the carrier air groups, this book solves the mystery at last.</p></p><p><p>Dallas Woodbury Isom is a retired professor of law at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon.

That's not to say Kalfar hasn't done his research. There are lovingly detailed passages on the minutiae of life in zero gravity, but all the whizzy space business is harnessed to the basic question of what it means to leave and whether it's possible to come back. The alien acts as a Proustian trigger for Jakub's memories . . .

David J. Whalen has looked deeply into the history of the industry and presents remarkable new information to tell a much different story. He finds that most of the satellite technology was privately developed by AT&amp;T and Hughes Aircraft Company, and that the market for satellite communications existed before the government stepped in. In this detailed history of satellite communication's earliest years, Whalen explains that NASA, the White House, and Congress intervened in satellite communications development to show the world that the U.S. was in the space race and that the billions of dollars the U.S. government planned to spend would result in practical applications. He traces many different outcomes of government intervention, such as the marginalization of AT&amp;T, who designed and paid for the first real communication satellite, Telstar 1; the positioning of Hughes as the dominant commercial satellite manufacturer; and the establishment of geosynchronous Earth orbit as the preferred orbit. Had the market been allowed to operate freely, AT&amp;T would have launched their commercial low-earth-orbit telephone satellite in the 1960s. Many previous histories of satellite communications have emphasized government contributions; this version is the first to focus on the industry's contributions.</p><p>David J.

As a child, Margaret White wanted to do "all the things women never do," and her nonconformist parents encouraged her. After a brief marriage at nineteen, Margaret combined her parents' surnames to re-christen herself Bourke-White, beginning a process of self-definition that is convincingly documented throughout the book. Margaret soon found the vehicle for her goals: photography. Single-minded hard work, an avid interest in the world, vigorous self-promotion, and a total lack of fear resulted in Margaret's evolution into one of the most famous and sought-after photographer-journalists of her day in an overwhelmingly male-dominated profession. Her photographs have become icons of this century: Fort Peck Dam on the first cover of <i>Life</i> magazine, flood victims during the Depression, Moscow under fire during World War II, survivors of Buchenwald concentration camp, Gandhi at his spinning wheel. In 1939, Margaret married writer Erskine Caldwell. Although the marriage was short-lived, it produced a collaboration of words and photographs comprising several books that chronicled the changes taking place in Russia, Europe, and the United States. For the last twenty years of her life, Margaret battled Parkinson's disease and the loneliness that increased isolation and inability to work imposed upon her. Yet she remained an optimist, writing her autobiography and living as full a life as possible with her characteristic passion and fearlessness. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Lynne Auld</i>A talented photography critic offers by far the best portrait of the super-star of photojournalism who died 15 years ago. Goldberg has made sensitive use of rich archival materials and interviews with Bourke-White's family, friends, and colleagues at Fortune and Life. Analyzing style and methods of work, she focuses on the tremendous drive to be not only the best but a celebrity. She also details the many love affairs and offers dramatic accounts of personal daring on assignments worldwide. Too manipulative, selfish, and demanding, Bourke-White is for much of the book unappealing. But in the Thirties her self-involvement gave way to social conscience, and her bravery during the long years with Parkinson's that ended her life wins the reader's admiration and sympathy.

The texts, many of them translated for the first time and some perhaps unfamiliar to Ukrainian readers, explore issues that intellectual history has traditionally set out to examine and explain. They touch on religious, philosophical, aesthetic, ethical, sociological, historical, and political ideas, and thereby illuminate significant attitudes, values, ideological commitments, and systems of thought that have crystallized at central moments in the development of Ukraine. Leading Ukrainian writers, scholars, intellectuals, political figures, and statesman present their views on Ukrainian history, especially its relation to Russia, but also discuss their society, literature, and culture, as well as the slow but dramatic formation and growth of national identity.</p><p>These texts best reflect the transformation of Ukraine, and the obstacles to such a transformation, into a modern nation, which in 1991 declared its independence. They serve, therefore, as a guide to a complex period of hundreds of years, which, up to now, was too often considered only as a part of Russian history. In this context, the anthology contributes to an understanding of the past few centuries from a post-colonial perspective.</p></p><p><b>Ralph Lindheim</b> is a member of the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the University of Toronto.<br></p><h2>Duino Elegies</h2><p>Named after the Castle of Duino on a rocky headland of the Adriatic, the &#34;Duino Elegies&#34; speak in a voice that is both intimate and majestic on the mysteries of human life and our attempt, in the words of the translator, &#34;to use our self-consciousness to some advantage: to transcend, through art and the imagination, our self-deception and our fear&#34;.</p><p>"[Gary Miranda's translation is] the nearest to a definitive <i>Elegies</i> we're apt ever to get in the English language." --John Mood, Author of <i>Rilke on Love and Other Dificulties</i> <p>"This is among the three most beautiful books I know.

Reprint.</p><p>Kate Ross is a trial lawyer with the Boston law firm Sullivan &amp; Worcester.YA?Julian Kestrel, a debonair man-about-town in early Victorian London, is asked to investigate the murder of Alexander Falkland. The charming aristocratic victim's distraught father turns to Kestrel when it seems that the Bow Street Runners have failed to turn up any clues. Nothing has been taken from the elaborate house, no one could have entered unnoticed in the middle of one of Falkland's famous parties, and everyone professes to have been on the best of terms with the deceased. As Kestrel delves into the case, he begins to find many people without adequate alibis, including Alexander's lovely widow. He is baffled by the solid wall of silence that he encounters; intrigued by the protective behavior of the servants; and, finally, starts to piece together Falkland's true character. With flair and quick-moving drama, the amateur detective is able to make the necessary connection between this murder and that of a servant in an abandoned brickfield. Kestrel, a true man of his times, treads carefully to maintain the correct conventions even as he digs deeply into the London lowlife. In this third novel about Kestrel, Ross builds on and develops her character so that readers recognize his strong personality, thus adding depth and dimension to the story.?Mary T.

For four years, Janet Adler's life was dominated by the transforming experience of a primal energy and the visions that were created by it.

It charts the entire course of English history and the social and political forces that shaped its society.</p><p>I was eight months pregnant and had just been told that I had to stay in bed until it was time to deliver. I was bored out of my mind. Reading was my therapy. Sarum was one of those books that I don't think I would have read unless confined to stay put. I am so glad that the timing was such that I got a chance to experience Rutherford's storytelling. The beginning of the book which is set in primitive England really hooked me and took me into the history of England gently by using the characters and families from generation to generation. While I am not a fan of English history, I am a lover of family sagas.

The book allows readers to unravel the meaning and context behind the myths and understand their cultural significance.</p><p>Philip Wilkinson has more than 50 titles to his credit in the fields of history, mythology, and the arts, including DK&#39;s Illustrated Dictionaries of Mythology and Religions and DK&#39;s Eyewitness Companion: Mythology, as well as A Celebration of Customs and Rituals of the World, which was endorsed by the United Nations.</p><h2>History Of Clocks And Watches</h2><p>The measurement of time was one of man&#39;s earliest obsessions, and the desire for ever greater precision in time-keeping has inspired generations in the fields of mathematics and science. Equally, each advance has produced accompanying works of great craftsmanship that have turned objects of sober function into things of outstanding beauty. Eric Bruton traces the path of this development from the simple shepherd&#39;s dial made of clay, through the rush of horological activity that followed the invention of the pendulum in the mid-seventeenth century, to the perfection escapement developments that form the basic principles of the complex electronic circuitry of our clocks and watches today. Combining specially commissioned line drawings, magnificent colour illustrations and a lucid, authoritative text, this book offers the reader a wonderful catalogue of man&#39;s achievement in the fields of science and art.</p><p>Eric Bruton is a Fellow of the British Horological Insititute and Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers but is best-known for his regular appearances on BBC TV&#39;s Antiques Roadshow.</p><h2>The Knife Went in: Real Life Murderers and Our Culture</h2><p>More than half a century ago, George Orwell wrote an essay about the decline of the English murder. Since the 1990s, Theodore Dalrymple has witnessed its modern variety in real life. For over a quarter of a century he has treated and examined many more murderers than most as a prison doctor, psychiatrist, and court expert in some of Britain&#39;s most deprived areas. Here, he delves deep into his life of personal encounters with the murderous underclass to determine what has changed overtime and what has not. Inimitably, his unique portrait of modern criminals is at the same time a parable of dysfunction in our own culture. Through his experiences, he exposes today&#39;s vicious cult of denial, blaming and psychobabble that hides behind a corrosive sentiment of caring. Illustrated with scores of eye-opening, true-life vignettes, The Knife Went In is in turn hilariously funny, chillingly horrifying, and always unexpectedly revealing. Taken together, this lifetime of experience is a clear and unsentimental mirror in which we view modern progress without its varnish.</p><p></p><h2>Cool Knits For Kids</h2><p>This book not only teaches you how to knit to fit, but it also helps you make sure everything fits.

As Master of the Guild of Nighthawks-thief-catchers and trackers-he'd spent the last week hunting for leads on the mysterious revolutionary leader, Mercury, whose humanist movement was plaguing London.</p> <p>And now he'd found one.</p> <p>No mention of the name Mercury, but Lynch's instincts were on fire at the rumor of a shipment that was due to be smuggled out of the steamy enclaves on the edges of the city-a particular shipment that was received every month at this time, though his informant hadn't known what it was.</p> <p>Easy enough to guess. The enclaves were both jail and factory, where the mechs within were forced to work steel in repayment for their mechanical limbs. This particular enclave was responsible for manufacturing mech parts for the automaton army that protected the aristocratic Echelon.</p> <p>In the distance, chimneys lurked in the smog like little watchtowers. A foghorn echoed mournfully as the boat slowly traversed the Thames. The world seemed unnaturally silent beneath its ethereal blanket, but for the faint whisper of movement in the shadows.</p> <p>"Here," someone murmured in the alley below him. "Is that them? Someone give 'em the signal."</p> <p>Lynch's head snapped up.</p> <p>Tendrils of fog eddied around a man on the other rooftop, licking at his legs and cloak-Garrett. Making a sharp gesture with his fingers, Lynch silently directed his lieutenant. There were four other shapes in the dark, but he couldn't see them, only hear a faint scraping sound that whispered on the tiles through his aural communicator. Made of fine brass pieces and leather, it fit in his ear perfectly, a transmitter receiving every whisper that Garrett made. Garrett's matching piece could relay his commands no matter where they both were.</p> <p>The sound of iron scraping over cobbles echoed in the still night. Someone hissed a warning and the sound cut off. Lynch leaned forward, cocking his head to listen.</p> <p>"Quiet." This was a voice of command, cool and low. "D'you want the world to 'ear us? Remember, the friggin' bleeders can 'ear for miles."</p> <p>Definitely humanists.</p> <p>Lynch crouched low on the edge of the tiled roof, his heart fluttering in his chest with anticipation. Darkness swallowed him as he leaned over the edge, his eyes picking out his prey immediately. One of the benefits of the craving virus that afflicted him was superior senses. A blue blood could see on the darkest of nights and hear the faintest whisper, though that barely made up for the fierce hunger he could never quite assuage, the unrelenting craving for blood...</p> <p>A trio of cloaked figures hovered in the alley, a phosphorescent flare stick shielded by one of their cloaks. One was a tall man, with broad shoulders beneath the concealing cloak and pockmarked cheeks. He knelt and dragged a heavy crate out of the open sewer grate in the cobbles.</p> <p>Lynch's eyes narrowed. There were men within the sewers, but he couldn't tell if they were from the enclaves or more of this mysterious group.</p> <p>Holding up a hand to counteract his previous command, Lynch melted back into the shadows to listen. If the mechs were using the nearby sewer systems to smuggle metalwork out of the enclaves, then the prince consort needed to know.</p> <p>A month ago, the humanists had tried to bomb the Ivory Tower, the seat of the Echelon's power. The handling of the bombing had been a disaster, with half the aristocratic Echelon trampling through his evidence and only one witness, who sullenly refused to talk, in custody. The only piece of evidence Lynch had was in his pocket: a piece of leather that had torn from a woman's cloak in one of the antechambers. A humanist, he suspected, and one involved in the bombing. The scent of her was long faded from the worn leather, but if he closed his eyes, he knew he could bring her scent to mind. It filled him, branding his memory as if he could never escape her.</p> <p>Maybe she would be below? His blood fired at the thought. He wanted to find her-he needed to. Though sometimes, in the dark of night, he wondered if his reasons for this madness were the same as the prince consort's.</p> <p>Swallowing hard, Lynch forced the thought of the mysterious woman from his mind. He had a job to do.</p> <p>What could the humanists be doing here? Were they after explosives? Or maybe a weapon to counteract the heavily armored metal automatons that patrolled the streets?</p> <p>He needed to get his hands on that crate.</p> <p>"Hurry," the leader snapped. "We're already behind schedule."</p> <p>A man grunted. "'S bloody heavy, you know?"</p> <p>"Steel often is," came the reply.</p> <p>"What's that?" someone hissed.</p> <p>Silence fell. Lynch faded back against the brickwork of a chimney.</p> <p>"Thought I saw somethin' movin'," the same person murmured. "Up there. On the roof."</p> <p>"Nighthawks?"</p> <p>"'Urry it up," the leader snapped. "We need to move. Now."</p> <p>Lynch scowled as one of the Nighthawks darted between chimneys. Too late. They'd been seen.</p> <p>Lynch stepped onto the incline of the roof and rode it to the edge, leaping out over nothingness. He saw Garrett and the others moving at the edge of his vision, then he landed in the swirling fog that clung to the cobbles below, his knees bending to absorb the shock.</p> <p>A man in a rough jerkin, with shoulders the size of a pugilist's, staggered to a halt in front of him, his mouth gaping in shock and both of his arms missing from the elbows down. He wore instead the heavy hydraulic arms of a mech, the work crude and rudimentary, without even the synthetic flesh the Echelon's master smiths could create. Enclave work.</p> <p>"Nighthawks!" the man bellowed, the hydraulic hoses in his steel arm hissing in the night as he swung a blow at Lynch.</p> <p>Grabbing the man by the wrist, Lynch kicked his feet out from under him and drove him onto his face on the cobbles.</p> <p>A shadow shifted in the fog. Lynch caught a glimpse of a dark-hooded cloak and a pistol gleaming in the weak, phosphorescent light of a fallen flare stick. "Let 'im go," the leader commanded in a low voice. He thumbed the hammer on his pistol back.</p> <p>Lynch could see little of his opponent beyond the cloak and a gaping blackness where his face should have been. A black satin mask covered his entire face and throat, leaving not an inch of skin visible. And he suddenly knew.</p> <p>"Mercury," he said, staring down the barrel of the pistol. Hungry exhilaration leaped through him, shadows sweeping through his vision as the hunger of the craving momentarily overtook him. The bastard was right in front of him.</p> <p>He heard the click a moment before the gun barrel coughed.</p> <p>Lynch flung himself into a roll as the gun retorted with a hollow thunk. A Nighthawk appeared behind him and stiffened, a tiny blue-feathered dart sticking out of his chest. Lewis Hicks, one of the novices. He staggered forward, gave a little sigh, then crumpled at Lynch's feet.</p> <p>Hicks's eyes remained open and he trembled on the cobbles, rigid as a board, momentarily paralyzed.</p> <p>Lynch looked up. The new hemlock darts the humanists were using to bring down blue bloods made him wary. The poison paralyzed a blue blood for a good five to ten minutes, leaving them at the human's mercy. As a predator, the sudden sense of vulnerability unnerved him.</p> <p>Mercury's shoulders stiffened but he wasted no breath. Instead, he turned and bolted down the alley, his cloak swirling the remnants of the fog and his shadow lengthening.</p> <p>"Scatter!" someone yelled.</p> <p>Men poured out of the sewers, scrambling past the Nighthawks. Garrett had a man shoved up against a wall and slapped cuffs on him. The humanists fled like mice, darting down alleys. There weren't enough Nighthawks to catch them all, but Lynch only needed one. Oh yes. Cut off the head of the snake and you had them all.</p> <p>"He's mine," he snapped to Garrett, leaving his lieutenant with the rest of them. Sprinting down the alley, he swiftly gained on the revolutionary, making a snatch at the man's cloak. It tugged for a moment and Mercury spun with a vicious left hook that smashed Lynch across the face. Pain slashed through his cheekbone, leaving his vision white for a second. There must have been something in the revolutionary's hand. Brass knuckles perhaps.</p> <p>Whirling, Mercury tore free of the cloak and bolted, leaving Lynch with a handful of fabric and the elusive scent of gunpowder.</p> <p>Curse it. Lynch started after him with deadly focus.</p> <p>The alleyway was running out, the stone walls that surrounded the enclaves rearing up into the night. Lynch slowed to a halt as Mercury spun, staring at him through the thin gauze of his eye slits.</p> <p>"Don't come any closer," the revolutionary leader warned, lifting the pistol again.</p> <p>"The problem with the new make of recoil dart gun is that it requires manual reloading. You appear to be out of darts. Or you would have used it on me already." He had no doubt of that.</p> <p>Mercury's chin tipped up as the pistol lowered. "That don't make me no less dangerous."</p> <p>Lynch rubbed at his jaw and the bruise that was no doubt starting to form. "I never expected it to. What did you hit me with?"</p> <p>"A love tap, milord." The words were laced with sarcasm. "Come closer and I'll give you another."</p> <p>They stared across the expanse of cobbles. Lynch frowned at his enemy's choice of words, something about the situation stirring unease through his gut. Behind him came shouts. He sensed Mercury's attention shift over Lynch's shoulder and then the revolutionary took a hesitant step backward, hitting the wall.</p> <p>"Nowhere to run," Lynch said softly. "Nowhere to hide."</p> <p>"There's always somewhere to run. Au revoir, sir." Tossing the steam pistol aside, Mercury whipped a heavier gun from the belt at his hip, with a sharp four-pronged hook at the end of it.</p> <p>For a moment, Lynch thought the revolutionary was going to fire it at him, but then he pointed it into the sky above and pulled the trigger.</p> <p>The grappling hook soared into the darkness with a hiss of rope trailing behind it. Metal clamored on stone far above, then the revolutionary jerked on the rope. It held and he pressed something on the side of the grappling gun.</p> <p>"No-" Lynch snapped, leaping forward.</p> <p>His fingers grazed the toe of Mercury's boot as the revolutionary sailed into the air. Laughter rang down through the darkness, thick with huskiness. Lynch snarled and slapped a palm against the stone. He'd had him. In the bloody palm of his hand and he'd lost him.</p> <p>Looking up, he bared his teeth. It was risky for a blue blood to enter the enclaves. Recent mech riots had seen dozens of mechs trampled in the streets by the metal Trojan cavalry. There was no love lost for a blue blood-or a craver, as the mechs called them.</p> <p>His eyes narrowed. He was dangerous too. And he'd spent over a year hunting the bastard, only to have Mercury slip through his fingers. The prince consort's warning rang dire in his ears. Bring me his head. Or share his fate.</p> <p>Not bloody likely. Looking around, Lynch shoved his boot into a crack between the stones in the wall and hauled himself up through sheer strength, biceps straining.</p> <p>It was the last thing Mercury would expect.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Steam hissed as the enormous piston rolled through its rotation. The woman known as Mercury hurried past, her breath hot and moist against the silk mask over her face and her eyes darting.</p> <p>Here in the enclaves, hot orange light lit the steel beams of the work sheds and enormous furnaces. The place was riddled with underground tunnels where the workers lived, but aboveground, the work sheds dominated. It wasn't quite a jail-mechs earned a half day off a fortnight-but it was close.</p> <p>Metal ingots glowed cherry red and the air was thick with the smell of coal. Men worked even at night to keep the furnaces hot, silent shadows against the shimmering heat waves. Rosalind slipped past a mech in a pitted leather apron as he shoveled coal into the open mouth of a furnace, the blast of heat leaving a light sheen of perspiration on her skin. Droplets of sweat slid beneath her breasts and wet the insides of her right glove. She couldn't feel the left. Only a phantom ache where the limb used to be and where steel now stood.</p> <p>Damn it. Rosalind tossed aside the spring-recoil grappling gun and started tugging at her right glove. Her heart wouldn't stop rabbiting in her chest, her body moving with a liquid anticipation she knew well. Foolish to relish such anticipation, but the danger, the edge of her nerves, were a drug she'd long been denied.</p> <p>She couldn't believe her bad luck. The Nighthawk himself, in the flesh.</p> <p>A man of shadow and myth. Rosalind hadn't gotten a good look at his face in the darkness, but the intensity of his expression was unmistakable and she'd felt the heavy caress of his gaze like a touch upon the skin. Her most formidable opponent, a man dedicated to capturing her and destroying the humanists. The shock of his arrival had thrown her, and Rosalind wasn't a woman who was surprised very often.</p> <p>She slipped between rows of fan belts with heavy metal automaton limbs on them. The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end. She'd known it was risky, making this one last trip, but she didn't have any choice. Martial law had choked the city ever since the bombing of the Ivory Tower and she needed the parts the mechs had promised her.</p> <p>The bombing had been a mighty blow for the aristocratic Echelon. Every major blue blood lord in the land, including the prince consort and his human queen had been gathered. If the attack had succeeded, it would have wiped out nearly all of the parasitic blue bloods, leaving the working classes-the humans-to cast off the yoke of slavery and servitude. No more blood taxes or blood slaves. No more armies of metaljacket automatons to keep them suppressed.</p> <p>A bold plan.</p> <p>If it had succeeded.</p> <p>For a moment Rosalind almost wished she'd thought of it, but the group of mechs she'd rescued from the steamy enclaves to work steel for her a year ago had gone behind her back. For the past six months, she'd urged for patience while the mechs had whispered that she was too soft, not merciless enough to lead the humanist movement. In the end, they'd taken matters into their own hands. Rosalind tried to stop the bombing attempt before it was too late, to try and save her younger brother, Jeremy. Instead, the mechanists had used him, seducing him with grand stories and sending him to deliver the bomb himself.</p> <p>It had been a catastrophe. The Echelon now understood the threat the humanists posed. Rosalind had been forced to scatter those still under her command as martial law settled its heavy weight over the city and the Echelon put a bounty on their heads. She and her older brother, Jack, had gone into hiding whil...</p></p><h2>The Survival Guide for Parents of Gifted Kids: How to Understand, Live With, and Stick Up for Your Gifted Child</h2><p>What does it mean to be &#x201c;gifted&#x201d;?

Child (1802-80), a largely self-educated New England baker's daughter, supported herself and her improvident husband through teaching, editing, and writing. Her works included Hobomok, the first novel to describe a marriage between a Native American and a white settler; domestic manuals such as The Frugal Housewife; antislavery propaganda; and a history of religion. Her own childhood, lost at age 13 when her mother died, was reclaimed in her stories for and about children and in her marriage to David Child, who wandered about pursuing noble but futile causes during their years together (which produced no offspring, apparently because of their ``childlike'' lovemaking). Child, Clifford tells us, rejected literary culture (she refused to meet Dickens, and dismissed Emerson as a ``wandering prophet'') and even feminists, preferring to work with men. Raised a Calvinist, she became a Swedenborgian, lived among Quakers, and participated in s&#x201a;ances. But there must have been more. Clifford neglects the Civil War, in which this ``crusader for freedom'' had considerable stake, as well as Child's literary contemporaries outside the salon- -including Emily Dickinson, her neighbor in Northampton, and Walt Whitman, who was involved in the same causes at the same time and places. The major problems here, however, are a strident voice (defending instead of presenting the life); soft focus (missing, in order to demonstrate a thesis, what was important to Child); and an overworked style marred by passive voice, baggy sentences, and the inflated rhetoric suggested by the title. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>A lively, if sometimes hyperbolic, life-and-times biography. Clifford depicts antislavery and women's rights advocate Child as a bohemian spirit and an angry conscience quick to write and speak against social injustice, even though she also found comfort among the cultivated set and intellectual pretensions of New England. Clifford is stronger on Child's life than on her times, offering much new information on Child's literary career and domestic advice books but little new on the reforms of the day. Still, this is a good book that captures the energy and vision of a woman reformer somewhat ahead of her time. Recommended for college and large public libraries.<br><i>- Randall M.

Accompanied by George Patton&#39;s great-uncle and a staff of able subordinates, the Bible-quoting general used his own unique view of past military doctrine to defeat a series of converging enemy armies. American military strategy has never been the same since. Jackson&#39;s aggressive personality enabled him to constantly maintain the initiative. While cloaking his own operations in tight security, he was often able to discern the aims of his opponent. Frequently outnumbered, he managed to keep enemy units separated, and to defeat them in detail. Jackson was able to co-ordinate infantry, cavalry, and artillery operations, and was particularly successful in turning the normally slow-moving infantry into an effective mobile strike force.Jackson&#39;s Valley Campaign is supplemented by sidebars on famous units, weapons, incidents, and in-depth personality profiles of Jackson and his opponents. Complete orders of battle and special maps that clearly illustrate Jackson&#39;s operational doctrine are enhanced by unique charts that show the distances and rates of march of Jackson&#39;s &#34;foot cavalry&#34; between all major points in the Shenandoah Valley.In the long-awaited revision of his out-of-print classic, the author describes Jackson&#39;s war of maneuver and the tactical ideas it represented, without losing sight of the individuals and units on both sides who tested military theory with their lives. John C. Fr�mont, &#34;Napoleon&#34; Banks, Turner Ashby, Belle Boyd, the Louisiana Tigers, Blenker&#39;s German Division, and the Stonewall Brigade all live again in this colorful but thoughtfully written account.</p><p><b>Dr. David G.

Turning his penetrating journalist&#x2019;s eye for observance and revelation onto his own life, Murray ventures back through his seventy-plus years with an unsparing honesty and clarity that age has afforded him. <br><br>Born to God-fearing Scottish parents, Murray grew up with little more than a handshake from his mother and a solidly constructed lack of confidence in his abilities and intellect. A sickly child with no siblings, he had only solitude to grow on&#x2013;a lonely meal, but one that fed his imagination and his talent for sketching out the subtleties of life that have made his columns so beloved. <br><br>From his struggles to put himself through college and his vivid experiences as a paratrooper in World War II, to his shaky acceptance of himself as a writer and his survival of immense personal tragedy, Murray addresses issues and emotions that society has long deemed taboo for men of his era: feelings of inadequacy, grief, family dysfunction, and most importantly, the indignities of age. But as he courageously sheds light on the difficult aspects of growing old, he discovers that there is more joy abundant in it than he ever imagined. <br><br>Whether he is relaying a war story or his poignant ritual of listening for his wife&#x2019;s breath each morning, Murray never shies away from a truth&#x2013;no matter how uncomfortable it may be. Propelled forward by the love of his work, a quiet devotion to his family, and an unceasing commitment to understanding his place in the world, he is an elegant reminder that the drive to live fully does not end at retirement. In his hands, aging is adventurous terrain, full of possibilities and unprecedented insight&#x2013;a time that we spend much of our life fearing but, when reached, bestows upon us unexpected gifts.</p><p>"In my seventies, I have discovered I am not who I thought I was--and never have been," writes Boston Globe columnist Donald Murray. Murray retired from his university teaching job at 62 and had a heart attack a few months later. This experience and the years of aging that followed led him to contemplate his "lives" by writing this memoir in his '70s. The title refers to the notion that a writer lives life twice: once in the moment, and again in "the greater reality of reflection afterwards." <p> Murray shares snippets of memories. As a child, he suffered beatings from his father (a leather shaving strap), his mother (a bone hairbrush, wet so it would hurt more), and the school bully (fists). He recounts how he found solace in books, notebooks, and make-believe siblings.</p><p> Throughout the book, we get glimpses of his life and the meanings or lessons he learned. His experience as an "animal of war"--a paratrooper and military policeman in World War II--taught him that "few of us who fought are ever discharged from our wars." He refers to the death of his 20-year-old daughter several times, and finally tells the whole story with as much pain as if it happened yesterday. He tells fond stories about his wife, Minnie Mae, only revealing toward the end the day-to-day reality of caring for a wife with Parkinson's. "We don't grow older in an even march but in sudden lurches," writes Murray. He doesn't fear his own death, but fears indignity and dependence. </p><p> <i>My Twice-Lived Life</i> does more than let us tiptoe into the private life and thoughts of an excellent writer--it beckons us to examine our own. <i>--Joan Price</i></p>Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist <b>Donald Murray</b> writes the weekly &#x201c;Over 60&#x201d; column for the <i>Boston Globe</i>. <i>Boston Magazine</i> and <i>The Improper Bostonian</i> magazine selected him best columnist in Boston in 1991 and 1996, respectively.

He is an expert in European comics and manga, and regularly lectures across the country on manga creation and anime. He lives in Portage, Michigan.Not all 12 artists Lehmann interviews are among Japan's most popular comic-book creators. Several are relatively obscure in their homeland, let alone here. But their diverse approaches to subject and style show there is more to <i>manga</i> than what Lehmann calls the "<i>anime</i>-esque" work that makes it Stateside. They include Hollywood movie buff Kia Asamiya, who has drawn such American characters as Batman (<i>Batman: Child of Dreams, </i>2003) and the X-Men; CLAMP, a four-woman collective that produces darker toned <i>shojo </i>(girls' <i>manga</i>); Takehiko Inoue, who scored with <i>Slam Dunk, </i>an action-packed serial about a high-school basketball team; Suehiro Maruo, who works in the erotic-grotesque <i>euo-guro</i> genre, fusing sex and violence; and Erica Sakurazawa, whose tales of young lovers have garnered comparisons to <i>Sex and the City. </i>Lehmann's questions focus unduly on mundanities: work habits, use of assistants, deadlines. Fans may wish he had probed more into content and the nature of the stories but will be fascinated by the behind-the-scenes details and the generous samples from stories that prompt seeking out more. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

During the second half of the nineteenth century, when the capital was transformed by an ambitious urban plan, its residents responded in kind, wearing styles as polished and modern as the city itself in order to participate in the exciting new social scene. Featuring famed paintings by such Impressionist masters as Degas, Cassatt, Manet, Monet and Morisot, this delightful book revisits the world of Parisian fashion through the eyes of first-hand observers. Thematic chapters present a gallery-like ensemble of paintings that follow in the footsteps of stylish Parisians as they stroll in the parks and boulevards, meet friends at caf�s, take in the theatre, relax at home and go on holiday. In an extended narrative-style caption to accompany each image, fashion and art historian Debra N. Mancoff offers a detailed discussion of what men and women wore and how their dress defined them. To complete the picture, illustrated interludes, providing glimpses into dressmaking, corsetry and millinery, the origins of couture and the rise of the department store, reveal how Paris became the fashion capital of the world.</p><p>DEBRA N. MANCOFF is Adjunct Professor of Art History, Theory and Criticism at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Her publications include Monet&#x2019;s Garden in Art (2001) and The Garden in Art (Merrell, 2011).

In the same manner that the best-selling<i> National Geographic Guide to the National Parks of the United States</i> covers America's crown jewels, this book will be a handy, practical, and extensively illustrated guide to help visitors plan and execute their trips to all the Canadian national parks. It also offers short excursions to 40 plus National Historical Sites and the four National Marine Conservation Areas. Written by authors who know Canada's national parks, this volume includes seasonal facts on these stunning and vital wilderness areas as well as guidance for getting there, when to go, how to visit, practical information on where to stay, and detailed descriptions of specific places within each park. Stunning photographs and custom, one-of-a-kind maps prepared by National Geographic cartographers enhance the entries. Just in time for the Parks Canada milestone anniversary, this guide will inspire visitors to celebrate the treasures of Canada, from the pristine shorelines of British Columbia's Pacific Rim to Newfoundland's Gros Morne and from the Arctic landscape of Aulavik to the prairies of Grasslands.</p><p><b>Prince Edward Island</b><br> Established 1937<br> 22 sq km/5,440 acres<br> &nbsp;<br> Prince Edward Island National Park spans a spectacular stretch of land encompassing sand dunes, salt marshes, remnants of an Acadian forest, coastal headlands, beaches, and sandstone cliffs. This is the land that inspired Lucy Maud Montgomery&#x2019;s Anne of Green Gables and prompted an oil tycoon to build an elegant Victorian home. Both Green Gables and Dalvay-by-the Sea are national treasures and showcased within the park.<br> &nbsp;<br> Approximately 285 million years ago, a mountain chain existed in this region. Over time, its rivers deposited gravel, silt, and sand into a low-lying basin forming sandstone bedrock. As the glaciers retreated, Prince Edward Island gradually took shape.<br> &nbsp;<br> Situated on the central north shore of Prince Edward Island, the park faces the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where sunsets are storybook perfect. Although one of the smallest parks in Canada, it&#x2019;s a popular destination, with famous beaches and outstanding coastal landscapes. The other attraction is the lure of Lucy Maud Montgomery through her beloved 1908 novel, <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> The park&#x2019;s ecosystems support a variety of animal species and 400 different species of plants. Although there are no deer or moose on the island, coyotes, red foxes, raccoons, beavers, mink, and weasels are common. With more than 300 species of birds, including the endangered piping plover, the park plays a significant role in shorebird migration in spring and fall.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1998, the park expanded to include 4 sq km (990 acres) on the Greenwich Peninsula where rare, U-shaped dunes known as parabolic dunes are located. This is also the region where archaeological digs revealed that Paleo-Indians lived here 10,000 years ago. Evidence indicates that Mi&#x2019;kmaq, French, Acadian, Scottish, Irish, and English were also early settlers here.<br> &nbsp;<br> The park is bordered by a number of traditional farming and fishing communities, which adds to the cul- tural fabric of the island and enhances the visitor&#x2019;s experience.&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re planning a trip to a Canadian park this year, be sure to pick up the new guide from National Geographic.&#x201d; &#x2013;About.com<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The book gives an overview of Canada&#x2019;s 42 parks and each section provides useful service information on &#x201c;How to Get There,&#x201d; &#x201c;When to Go,&#x201d; and &#x201c;How to Visit.&#x201d; Plus you&#x2019;ll find lists of hotels, campsites, and tour operators to help you plan your trip.&#x201d; &#x2013;Intelligent Travel<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;When it comes to exploring this expansive, gloriously beautiful country of ours, it&#x2019;s hard to know where to start.

In fascinating detail, Bate explains how words like &#39;culture&#39; and &#39;environment&#39; have evolved since the writing of Jane Austen, Thomas Hardy and the Romantics to the present day.</p><p>Jonathan Bate, born in 1958, is King Alfred Professor of English Literature at the University of Liverpool, and was previously Fellow of Trinity Hall, Carnbridge. He has edited Arden Shakespeare editions and is author of The Genius of Shakespeare and a novel, The Cure for Love. He writes regularly for the Telegraph, TLS and Independent and often appears on radio and TV. He lives in the Wirral with his wife and son and is currently working on a biography of John Clare.An engaging, closely researched selection of poets whose mediating powers between humans and the natural world have helped restore our links to the earth.Bate (English/Univ. of Liverpool) clearly illustrates the importance of poetry in expressing the human bond with nature. He deploys the works of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, Byron, Wallace Stevens, Elizabeth Bishop, Edward Brathwaite, Les Murray, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Paul Celan-for starters. He discusses "Byron's easy yoking of politics and nature," Keats's "meditation on how human culture can only function through links and reciprocal relations with nature," and how John Clare functions "as a scapegoat: only by alienating himself can he restore us to the <i>oikos</i>." There is a good deal of jargon ("Fanon and Simone de Beauvoir taught us that the defining Others . . ."), but when Bate tenders a few ideas of his own, the reading gets good. His consideration of the role of weather in such poems as Keats's "To Autumn" ("I propose that in order to read it livingly in the age of ecocide we must begin with the knowledge that we have no choice but to live with the weather") is inventive and revealing, as is his sense of the organic ("metre itself-a quiet but persistent music, a recurring cycle, a heartbeat-is an answering to nature's own rhythms, an echoing of the song of the earth itself"). It may well be that a poem can be a "revelation of dwelling" (as opposed to a simple prose narrative)-but more to the point is "the possibility that certain textmarks called poems can bring back to our memory humankind's ancient knowledge that without landmarks we are lost."An eccentric but worthwhile study. -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

As educators and students we are quick to think about the &#x2018;what&#x2019; and the &#x2018;how&#x2019; of the college experience. What is general education? How can I get these requirements completed? What do I do with myself in this new environment?

These questions lack straightforward answers, but they are crucial for instructors to ask and students to address individually and uniquely. Finding personal meaning in one&#x2019;s education requires introspection and self-awareness that comes through grappling with core assumptions and values, and rummaging through implicit expectations to identify genuine interests and concomitant goals.</p><p>This text facilitates this learning process by posing these fundamental questions and providing frameworks for thinking about how they might impact a student&#x2019;s approach to their learning and life. It has less to do with the content of the articles and more to do with guiding students as they ponder a range of &#x2018;whys&#x2019; and grapple with the juxtaposition of new perspectives with their current viewpoints. It encourages students to examine themselves, their worldview, their resiliency, their purpose, and their calling. It invites them to entertain thoughts that may seem dissonant or ambiguous in order to encourage a deeper level of learning.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Divide</h2><p>A unique and humorous fantasy that weaves a cast of eccentric and charming characters into an incredible adventure story.<br><br>When Felix's parents take him to "The Divide"--a spot in Costa Rica where the waters that run down to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans separate--Felix finds himself in a bizarre parallel world where mythical creatures and magic are a reality.<br>There, he meets Betony, a tangle child and herbalist who becomes his friend in this strange land.

In <i>Untold Stories</i>, Bennett describes his mother's fight with depression, his own illness and being savagely mugged in Italy with his partner, Rupert Thomas. As the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> declared, "This thick book is so full of good things they could sell it for twice the price . . . 'All masterpieces are eloquent,' [Bennett] writes in one of his art-historical pieces. 'Not all of them are articulate.' <i>Untold Stories</i> is both." "[Alan Bennett's]&nbsp;1994 book, <i>Writing Home</i>, a collection of diary entries, prefaces to his plays and odd bits of literary journalism, was a surprise best seller in Britain, and now he has followed it up with <i>Untold Stories</i>, an even larger and more varied grab bag. It, too, contains prefaces and diary entries, and also book reviews and introductions, what appear to be some memorial-service tributes, some lectures and essays about art (a particular passion of Bennett's) and three surprising, funny and deeply affecting memoirs: about his family, about getting beaten up in Italy and about his very close call with colon cancer in 1997." <b>Charles McGrath, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><b><i></i></b>&nbsp;"Bennett has taken the vulgarity not to mince words out of confessional writing by his humor, compassion (for those who deserve it), and self-deprecation . . . the quietly penetrating decency of this big book is a genuine balm." <b>Katherine A. Powers, <i>Boston Globe</i></b><b><i></i></b>&nbsp;<p>"Alan Bennett is undoubtedly one of the most popular writers of recognized literary merit in England . . . He is, in short, a national treasure, and the popularity of his occasional writings . . . is both a symptom and confirmation of that status . . . Again and again in this book he demonstrates that almost anything that happens to a person can be interesting, moving and entertaining if you write about it well enough." <b>David Lodge, <i>The </i></b><b><i>New York</i></b><b><i> Review of Books</i></b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's tempting to see <i>Untold Stories</i> as a comedy in which the hero, after much hardship, finds lasting love and fingers crossed health. But that would underplay the sheer (which is not always to say pure) pleasure of so many entries. Whether he's sharing some of his favorite paintings with schoolchildren . . . or taking us through his student rooms (and dreams) at Oxford, Alan Bennett may not be 'a joiner' but he is brilliantly engaged and engaging.&#x201d; <b>Kerry Fried, <i>Newsday</i></b></p>&nbsp;"[This collection] is told with such honesty that it is heartbreaking and deeply moving . . . Bennett's experience is a reminder that the people we care for, though they may never have made much of a stir in the world, have nevertheless for us a value beyond price . . . This piece should be required for all health-care workers, as it is a vivid reminder of what it actually feels like to be a patient and at the mercy of large impersonal forces including the health-care system itself and the fates." <b>Keith Monroe, </b><i><b>Winston-Salem</b></i><b><i> Journal Book Review</i></b>&nbsp;"I have never read a book of this length where I have turned the last page with such regret. It is intelligent, educated, engaging, humane, self-aware, cantankerous and irresistibly funny. You want it to go on for ever." <b>John Carey, <i>The Sunday Times</i> (London)</b><b></b>&nbsp;"A great achievement and a book of lasting value . . . This is art of no mean order, though subtly concealed . . . It is full of humour, without pomposity or self-dramatisation. Bennett has always been conscious, like Thoreau, that most people lead lives of quiet desperation, but he also sees that they are funny, and he has a matchless talent for making them interesting." <b>Jane Stevenson, <i>The Observer</i> (London)</b><b></b>&nbsp;"Extraordinary . . . Bennett writes: 'I have never found it easy to belong.' After <i>Untold Stories</i>, I have no hesitation in saying he belongs to all of us. And we're all grateful." <b>Cal McCrystal, <i>The Independent</i></b></p><p><p><b>Alan Bennett</b> is a renowned playwright and essayist whose screenplay for <i>The Madness of King George</i> was nominated for an Academy Award. He lives in London, England.</p>"Literature," said Ford Madox Ford, "is that writing which most reveals the personality of the writer." Given this, the diary and memoir should be the most demanding of genres because they are the most intimate -- and the flashiest. Success or failure depends almost entirely on personal style, on matters of tone, voice, sex appeal. It obviously helps to be cranky and eccentric like Evelyn Waugh or as smart and mean as Virginia Woolf. It certainly doesn't do to be shy and decent.<p>And yet, paradoxically, this is the secret of Alan Bennett's success with his two largely autobiographical collections, Writing Home (a No. 1 bestseller in Britain 12 years ago) and this latest, Untold Stories (a No. 1 bestseller in Britain last fall). These books consist of extracts from Bennett's diaries; homages to dead friends, both famous and not; recollections of his childhood and early life in Leeds; talks or articles about the theater, art and film; and a handful of book reviews. All this casual-seeming writing, no matter what the occasion, possesses a kind of Anglican quietness, refusing the histrionic or grandstanding while still managing to be humorous, surprising, disarmingly human. There is probably no other distinguished English man of letters more instantly likable than Bennett. What other successful playwright, after all, rides around London on a bicycle?</p><p>Alan Bennett? To be famous in Britain isn't necessarily to be famous in the United States. (And vice versa: At one point in Untold Stories, Bennett reads with great admiration a book by the noted American food writer M.F.K. Fisher and admits he's never heard of her.) The son of a butcher, Bennett won a scholarship to Oxford, received a First Class degree (by a fluke, he claims), then studied and taught medieval history to undergraduates for five years. In his middle twenties his life again changed when he and three friends joined forces in the 1960s to create the celebrated satirical revue "Beyond the Fringe." Once launched into the theater, Bennett found his real vocation and went on to write stage and television plays (and sometimes to act in them). Perhaps he is best known here for the Academy Award-nominated film based on his drama "The Madness of George III."</p><p>Despite having garnered a variety of glittering prizes, Bennett declines to take his success too seriously. He has, for instance, turned down numerous honors, including a knighthood. An easy mark, he (now famously) allowed the derelict and half-mad Miss Shepherd to park her van in the garden of his Camden Town house, where she proceeded to live until her death nearly 15 years later. Most of all, though, Bennett values what one might call his domesticity -- writing, listening to music, visiting museums and old churches, occasionally lunching with friends. </p><p>Only in this latest volume does he speak about the sexual anxieties of his early years, his homosexuality and his treatment for cancer. Yet even in these highly charged areas of life, the voice on the page remains calm, kindly and sensible. When he was diagnosed with colon cancer, he says, "people talk of courage as if there were a choice, whereas one shows courage very often because there doesn't seem to be much alternative."</p><p> The longest single piece in this book, "Untold Stories," is a masterpiece of reminiscence, one in which Bennett recreates both his early family life and the old age of his mother and father:</p><p>"The nearest my parents came to alcohol," he recalls, "was at Holy Communion and they utterly overestimated its effects. However bad the weather, Dad never drove to church because Mam thought the sacrament might make him incapable on the return journey." Alas, his mother's inclination to fret became worse in later years when Mam unexpectedly began to worry more and more about people spying on her. The woman who always dreaded the spotlight gradually grew increasingly paranoid, frozen with fear, and eventually needed to be hospitalized. For weeks at a time, Bennett's father drove back and forth a hundred miles every day to visit the girl he had loved since childhood, and the strain soon took its toll -- he died of a heart attack at 71. </p><p>For 20 years, Bennett visited his mother's nursing home every two or three weeks, even when Mam no longer knew his name or recognized his face. (She finally died at 91.) This will be, for many older readers, a distressingly familiar story, yet Bennett leavens its pathos by moving in and out of the past, bringing into a timeless present the family's laughter, the outings to the movies, the holiday feasts. "With her regular gifts of shoe-trees Aunty Kath had hitherto held the record for boring Christmas presents, but [her new husband] Bill shows he is no slouch in this department either when he presents me with the history of some agricultural college in New South Wales (second volume only).</p><p>" 'You did history, Alan. This should interest you.' " </p><p>As he would doubtless acknowledge, Bennett's values and firm character -- in every photograph he wears a jacket and tie and frequently a sweater as well -- derive from the example of his parents. But his humor, I suspect, is his own, and certainly his genius for description. In "Seeing Stars," he recalls the screen legends of the 1930s and '40s, including that "whole string of tall, elegant 'professional women' . . . Alexis Smith, Rosalind Russell, Eve Arnold -- women who could perch casually on the edge of an editorial desk, toss one long silk-stockinged leg over the other while lighting a cigarette or consulting a powder compact. Graceful and expensive as racehorses, they were amused, ironic, and sceptical; they wrote newspaper columns in papers, edited magazines and were funny about love and romance with men just their playthings."</p><p>Readers of the London Review of Books know that one of the highlights of the Christmas season is its selections from Bennett's diary for that year. Untold Stories reprints those published between 1996 and 2004. In these pages, Bennett attends the memorials for John Gielgud and Alec Guinness, rages against the inhumane policies of modern governments, visits art galleries in Venice, New York and the Netherlands. At a Vermeer exhibition, this trustee of the National Gallery frankly thinks to himself, "If I were to put my fist through this painting . . . things would be irrevocably changed and my whole life be seen as leading up to this act." Another day he notes that "it's thought that most of the frocks that Princess Diana is selling off will end up in the wardrobes of transvestites." He repeatedly laments the further degradation of his classical musical station, wishes that the people who so efficiently fix his car's flat tire could take charge of his entire life and comments sharply on the books he is reading. Of Saul Bellow's Ravelstein he writes, "I'm never entirely comfortable with (and never unaware of) Bellow's style, which puts an almost treacly patina on the prose -- designer prose it is, good, tasteful and self-evidently rich." </p><p>Toward the end of this wonderful book, Bennett reflects on the perennial insecurities of the writer's life -- and here, as nearly always, he strikes on the simple, yet often unacknowledged truth: "The evidence of a lifetime's work, his or her books ranged on the shelf (or shelves), ought to reassure someone who writes that he or she is indeed a writer. But nothing, not the books in the shop window or the play on the stage or shoals of letters from delighted readers, furnishes such assurance but only the act of writing itself, the fingers flying over the keys or, in my case, pushing the pen across the paper."</p><p>Let me close with a sentence that neatly summarizes why Bennett is so endearing. It's from the opening to his appreciation of the director Lindsay Anderson:</p><p>"At the drabber moments of my life (swilling some excrement from the steps, for instance, or rooting with a bent coat-hanger down a blocked sink) thoughts occur like 'I bet Tom Stoppard doesn't have to do this' or 'There is no doubt David Hare would have deputed this to an underling.' " There you have the glory of Alan Bennett: You don't have to be a famous playwright to know just how he feels.</p><p>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Although ceramics are most often used for placing the peoples who produced them in time, they can also provide important clues to past economic organization.This volume covers nearly 1000 years of southwestern prehistory and history, focusing on ceramic production in a number of environmental and economic contexts. It brings together the best of current research to illustrate the variation in the organization of production evident in this single geographic area.The contributors use diverse research methods in their studies of vessel form and decoration. All support the conclusion that the specialized production of ceramics for exchange beyond the household was widespread. The first seven chapters focus on ceramic production in specific regions, followed by three essays that re-examine basic concepts and offer new perspectives. Because previous studies of southwestern ceramics have focused more on distribution than production, Ceramic Production in the American Southwest fills a long-felt need for scholars in that region and offers a broad-based perspective unique in the literature. The Southwest lacked high levels of sociopolitical complexity and economic differentiation, making this volume of special interest to scholars working in similar contexts and to those interested in craft production.</p><p><b>Barbara J.

Germany has allied itself with the Ottoman empire, persuading the caliphs of Turkey to declare a jihad on the British empire, as President Woodrow Wilson hesitates to enter the fray. War correspondent and American spy Christopher Marlowe Cobb has been tasked to follow a man named Brauer, a German intellectual and possible secret service agent, into perilous waters aboard the ship Lusitania, as the man is believed to hold information vital to the war effort. Aboard the Lusitania on its fateful voyage, Cobb becomes smitten with famed actress Selene Bourgani, who for some reason appears to be working with German Intelligence.<br><br>Soon Cobb realizes that this simple actress is anything but, as she harbors secrets that could pour gasoline on the already raging conflict. Following the night of the infamous German U-Boat attack on the Lusitania, Cobb must follow Selene and Brauer into the darkest alleyways of London, then on to the powder keg that is Istanbul. He must use all the cunning he possesses to uncover Selene&#x2019;s true motives, only to realize her hidden agenda could bring down some of the world's most powerful leaders.<br></p><p>Robert Olen Butler is the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of fourteen novels, six story collections, and a book on the creative process, From Where You Dream.

Gorgeously illustrated, the weighty coffee-table book is organized by decade, allowing it to broadly contextualize the strips into the historical periods that gave them life. There are also brief, page-long bios of their most notable creators, among them Richard Outcault (The Yellow Kid and Buster Brown), Frank King (Gasoline Alley), Cliff Sterrett (Polly and Her Pals), Harold Gray (Little Orphan Annie) and Chester Gould (Dick Tracy). For the most part, however, Walker wisely steps back and lets the strips tell their own stories&#x2014;a good decision since the one fault of the book lies in his prose, which tends to chug along with a kind of bland lethargy that doesn&#x2019;t quite rise to the verve of his subject. While informative and factually interesting, his writing often contains all the vigor of a college textbook. But the strips themselves are perfectly chosen and lovingly laid out: from the fanciful slapstick of the Katzenjammer Kids to the protosurrealist dreamscapes of Windsor McKay&#x2019;s Little Nemo and the obsessively reenacted dramas of unrequited love in George Herriman&#x2019;s Krazy Kat.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He has contributed to such publications as <i>Rolling Stone</i> and <i>Reader's Digest</i>, and has written a book, <i>The OZ Files</i>, about the Australian UFO story.Concluding volume of The Quintara Marathon trilogy (The Demons at Rainbow Bridge, The Run to Chaos Keep), this one galloping all over the alternate dimensions and told in three modes of internalized or telepathic nonverbal communication. Book One found the awakening from suspended animation of some nasty, taloned, horned demons who were affecting Earth culture as well as every society in the three galactic empires: The Exchange, the Mycohl, and the Mizlaplan. In Book Two, a scientific team sent by the Exchange was slaughtered by the demons, and small rescue teams from each empire pursued the monsters through an interdimensional gate. Here, the three empire teams forge into one team of five Terrans that has chased the demons of ultimate evil to a city of the damned on a desolate planet ruled by The Other, the master of the Quintara, an unseeable, mind-blocking creature ``at the heart of this horror.'' Even the demon princes are as dust specks compared to The Other. Will The Other--Baal--turn the present and future populations of the three empires into 90 trillion Fausts? Only the martyrdom of small, sandy-haired Irishman Jimmy McCray, who plunges a crucifix into the Evil One's chest, can save the nondemonic beings in all dimensions as we will know them--tomorrow?

It had just hit him. He had not happened upon just any old wino. The man standing down in the bin was Dorset's most famous and reclusive resident, Wendell Frye, the man who had single-handedly redefined modern American sculpture...His towering, breathtaking scrap-metal sculptures graced plazas and parks throughout the world, his name echoing alongside that of Alexander Calder, Isamu Noguchi ad Ellsworth Kelly...If the art critic from Mitch's paper somehow got a chance to meet him, she would, well, plotz.. And here Mitch was standing in a dumpster talking to him about Abbott and Costello.</i><br><br>Transplanted New York film critic Mitch Berger is discovering a whole new world in the idyllic atmosphere of wealthy Dorset, Connecticut, not the least of which is his new love. That's Resident State Trooper Desiree Mitry, beautiful, bright, and strong-minded. Des has transferred out of her position as the highest-ranking black woman in the State Police Homicide department to give more time to the art for which she has a sure talent. <br><br>Shortly after Mitch's encounter with "Hangtown" Frye in the town dump, his new friend suffers the worst blow of his life - his beloved daughter "Moose" is killed when her sister's car, which she was driving, explodes. It's very soon clear that the explosion was no accident, and Des, as one more familiar with the community than the state cop in charge, takes an advisory part in the investigation. <br><br>As one of the very few Dorset citizens with whom Frye will have any truck, Mitch is involved in two directions - as a good friend willing to help as he can around the dilapidated farmhouse that is Frye's ancestral home, and as the devoted, if unlikely, lover of the police officer unofficially but very actively on the case.<br><br>Meanwhile, the old town is coming to a boil over the question of a new public elementary school, one that will be built with contributions from a developer with nothing but good wishes for the education of the local children, and coincidentally a program of healthful outdoor living for those who can afford the homes he will build on the old school property. Hangtown and Mitch are among the dispute's dubious. In a climax that is a realistic and frightening version of a tour through an amusement park "haunted" house, the film critic and his policewoman love come close to tragedy. <br><br>Readers met these "wonderfully drawn characters [Susan Isaacs] and "best buddy team to come along in years" [Jeffrey Deaver] in Handler's first book of the series, <i>The Cold Blue Blood</i>.

The romance between Des and Mitch, an ill-kept secret in tiny Dorset, and bits of film trivia woven smoothly into the narrative add zest."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"The style in this book is smooth with tightly woven scenes and believable dialogue.

We&#x2019;re well into April, but at this hour it&#x2019;s cold, so I tuck my hands in my sleeves.<br> <br>My breath mists, but I have nothing on the chain-smokers exhaling those vast clouds. A part of me would love to try it, but the whole (now) only child with asthma situation makes a boy promise certain things to his mother.<br> <br>I catch Pard watching me. He exhales sideways, like a parent just caught him in the act. Something in his face, some trace of a question left over from last week, makes me turn my back on him.<br> <br>I focus on my pack and duffel, make sure I&#x2019;ve got my shit together. No one has said hi to me yet.<br> <br>They would have if Cannon were here, but Cannon isn&#x2019;t coming. Not today.<br> <br>I nod to myself like I&#x2019;ve confirmed packing what I meant to pack, and then edge closer to Reiko and that circle of girls. Her friends are recapping prom, which is just another reminder of how popular she&#x2019;s become.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I manage.<br> <br>She takes in my groggy face and gives me a little squeeze. &#x201c;Aww, Jeff.&#x201d;<br> <br>I grit my teeth and smile. We dated our freshman year, but now she treats me like I&#x2019;m a kid&#x2014;like she has matured and I haven&#x2019;t.<br> <br>The girls go on talking, cheerful despite the hour, and start chatting up their latest admissions offers. Reiko&#x2019;s going to Penn, or maybe Georgetown. She says she&#x2019;s going to check out the campus again while we&#x2019;re in D.C. this weekend. I nod and wonder if she&#x2019;d let me tag along, since I got into Georgetown too. Maybe now is my chance to ask her.<br> <br>&#x201c;You look so sleepy,&#x201d; Reiko says, and pats my cheek. If she likes touching me so much, then why did she break up with me? Except I know the answer to that already.<br> <br>I just nod, because sleepiness excuses social ineptitude.<br> <br>The girls go back to discussing their college plans while clutching pillows and putting on lip gloss, which is hot to watch and generally looking like my dream slumber party come true. Being invisible is sometimes a pretty sweet deal. I wonder how I can sit next to any of these girls for the six-hour ride. Maybe share a pillow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>But then Frye strolls up. I&#x2019;m hoping he&#x2019;ll decide to mooch a cigarette, like he mooches a ride every day to get to school, and leave us nonsmokers alone. Instead, he parks himself right in Reiko&#x2019;s physical space and says, &#x201c;Whoa, how can you look this good this early in the morning?&#x201d;<br> <br>He&#x2019;s probably not hitting on her. I mean, Frye gets in everyone&#x2019;s space. There have been a couple times when I even wondered if Frye were coming on to me, but then realized he gets thatsuperclose to everyone. Still, I smell his mouthwash from here.<br> <br>I sneak my hand over my mouth and quietly check on my own breath.<br> <br>Reiko ruffles Frye&#x2019;s hair. She has to bend backward to do it, because he&#x2019;s that close to her, leaning over, palm-tree style. She laughs, and he laughs, and then she laughs some more. When did this thing start? He&#x2019;s saying something about these YouTube videos teaching him how to give massages, and the girls are like, Show us! So he slides his hands over Reiko&#x2019;s shoulders, and I pretend to check my phone, because I can&#x2019;t watch.<br> <br>The yellow bus pulls up the same time Mr. Bailey does. He&#x2019;s toting a huge thermos of coffee. No wonder he&#x2019;s smiling.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, kids! Let&#x2019;s do this!&#x201d;<br> <br>Everyone reaches for their packs, and I wonder for the hundredth time who will sit with me now that Cannon isn&#x2019;t coming.<br> <br>On cue, my phone vibrates, for real. At 5:15 a.m.<br> <br>U on the way?<br> <br>I text him back. Lining up. Sucks you aren&#x2019;t coming.<br> <br>Screw them!<br> <br>Yeah, I text. Unfair. Of all the days to be suspended, it had to be today.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t worry. I have a plan. Revenge!<br> <br>My breath catches. Cannon always has a plan, and while I miss having him here, his plans sometimes scare me. Especially after the senior prank. How do you tell your only real friend that he went too far? He&#x2019;d only say what he&#x2019;s said countless times before: that I need to get out of my shell. Can&#x2019;t argue with that.<br> <br>What plan? I ask.<br> <br>His reply&#x2019;s as cheerfully cryptic as a fortune cookie. I&#x2019;m going to kidnap you. :)<br> <br>I think of all the things Cannon has pulled off&#x2014;high stakes poker matches, parties with insane amounts of alcohol, and then, yes, hacking&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m nervous. He means well, but still.<br> <br>What?? I text back.<br> <br>Pick you up when u get here. Meet some G friends. Party.<br> <br>G friends could mean girlfriends, or not. He&#x2019;s still on this mission to make me go to Georgetown. He&#x2019;s been talking up this guy who will get me connected to the scene there. But I don&#x2019;t buy his plan to meet me in D.C. You&#x2019;re going to drive six hours just to show me around Georgetown?<br> <br>Not going to. I&#x2019;m HERE. Gonna help you make connections for next year. Introduce u, have fun. I&#x2019;m gonna pass out. Later.<br> <br>Suddenly my chest feels tight, and it has nothing to do with the smoke. I don&#x2019;t know what Cannon has planned. Yes, I got into Georgetown, and he&#x2019;d said he knew someone there I should meet. Was he really going to introduce me to that guy? It&#x2019;s kind of nice he wants to help, except I&#x2019;m not sure who this guy is, or what he&#x2019;d expect from me. I never fully know what to expect from Cannon. It&#x2019;s never just fun with him. He&#x2019;ll get you into a party, the kind you see in movies, and then at some point he has a signature he wants you to copy, and you don&#x2019;t know whose it is or what it&#x2019;s for, but you sign a check, a really small amount, just a prank, but you feel like maybe you shouldn&#x2019;t. You just do your little part, and then he does what he does with it.<br> <br>Quintessential Cannon. I know somehow that he&#x2019;ll have Mr. Bailey&#x2019;s itinerary, and he&#x2019;ll be there, but running off to meet his friends is risky. He knows I can&#x2019;t have any trouble this semester, that I actually want to get into the schools where I&#x2019;m wait-listed, so why would he do this to me?<br> <br>I look up and see that I&#x2019;m alone outside the bus.<br> <br>I climb the iconic rubber-tread steps that seemed so huge in second grade. Come to think of it, the steps still feel huge. Buses are just weird that way.<br> <br>I hesitate just inside, front and center, and it&#x2019;s like being onstage without a script as I scan for a seat that will not lower an already shaky social standing.<br> <br>Front left, Reeve faces the back of the bus with his knees on his seat, so I get an unwanted view of his scrawny ass. He whips around to stare me down with his unibrow power. He&#x2019;s a pretty weird sight, and I wouldn&#x2019;t mind telling him so, but he&#x2019;s poised with his clipboard to record every offense against him and every breach in school regulations. He&#x2019;s been class treasurer for two years and founded the school&#x2019;s Discipline Committee (a committee of one), which basically makes him a modernized hall monitor.<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t sit at the front of the bus.<br> <br>I try to look confident, like I&#x2019;m actually going to be a famous author, and one day the popular guys in the back will say to their kids and grandkids around the Thanksgiving table, &#x201c;Jeff Chaucer, you say? Yeah, back in high school, he wrote my paper on Virginia Woolf&#x2014;I still have it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Reeve returns to his spying position as I pass him. Luckily, there are a couple free seats farther back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. except when I get there, it turns out these spaces aren&#x2019;t free after all.<br> <br>Plugged into his headphones, Mace is slumped alone where I couldn&#x2019;t see him before.<br> <br>And, like fate, Pard has the seat across the aisle. His shoes are propped on the seat, and he&#x2019;s curled around his sketchbook so I can&#x2019;t see it, but it&#x2019;s there, and he&#x2019;s drawing, like always. The little Band-Aid he&#x2019;s been wearing on his finger is gone. I&#x2019;m still not used to him without his hat&#x2014;he looks just like he did freshman year, like we&#x2019;re in a time warp, but of course, everything has changed. He doesn&#x2019;t acknowledge I&#x2019;m right here staring.<br> <br>Now I have a dilemma. When a person walks this far into a bus, you can&#x2019;t turn back. It&#x2019;s social death. Sitting near Reeve would suck, but sitting near these two guys from my past would also suck. Mace cracks his knuckles like he wants to crack my head. Even if I wanted to risk that, I won&#x2019;t risk Mace&#x2019;s epic acne, facial flakes, and eyebrow dandruff.<br> <br>That leaves Pard, who alternates between nibbling his pencil and sketching with his head down in an I don&#x2019;t see you standing right there pose. I don&#x2019;t ask for favors, not from him, not standing in the aisle, where people are watching. But I&#x2019;m Cannon&#x2019;s friend. I can do this.<br> <br>&#x201c;Move over,&#x201d; I tell his scalp. Pard&#x2019;s hair is still wet from the shower and combed, but so thin I can see his head underneath, even paler than his hair. Kind of weird-looking, yet vulnerable&#x2014;just like his face, which has never seen a shave. I&#x2019;m not exaggerating either. Not one shave, and he&#x2019;s almost eighteen. No wonder I&#x2019;m thinking of freshman year when I see his face frozen in time like that.<br> <br>His head snaps up, and his brown eyes are proof that he&#x2019;s not albino (though let&#x2019;s not rule out the possibility that he&#x2019;s wearing contacts). They also reveal the soul of a Balrog. Right now those furious eyes say how much he hates me, even as he puts his feet down and signals for me to climb over. I try to creep past without touching him, but the backs of my calves awkwardly brush his knees. The unwanted contact makes me scoot so far over that I&#x2019;d fall out if it weren&#x2019;t for the window, permanently shut.<br> <br>Pard rolls his eyes and then goes back to his sketchbook, always angled so I can&#x2019;t see, like he does when we&#x2019;re both in the library with our doctor&#x2019;s notes excusing us from PE. I don&#x2019;t know why Pard never has PE, but I&#x2019;m out whenever it&#x2019;s too strenuous. (Yes, my mother made this happen.)<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, everyone,&#x201d; Mr. Bailey says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a six-hour drive, plus breaks. Let&#x2019;s just relax and enjoy the ride, okay?&#x201d; He delivers the rules: no getting out of your seat, no eating, no drinking, no this, no that. &#x201c;Any questions?&#x201d;<br> <br>Of course, this is an open invitation.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are we there yet?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can I go to the bathroom?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can we get a commemorative tattoo when we get there?&#x201d;<br> <br>This from Alison, sitting like a queen bee, back center with her two football stars on either side. With one leg propped over Rooster&#x2019;s huge knee, she&#x2019;s leaning back into Kai&#x2019;s shoulder. From his right, Kai&#x2019;s girlfriend, Briony, casts spitfire looks, but Alison doesn&#x2019;t notice. Briony must lie awake at night wondering what guys see in Alison Chavez. Unlike Briony, with the blond hair, the bikini body, the baby blue eyes, Alison isn&#x2019;t that kind of pretty. But she&#x2019;s got your attention like no one else. I don&#x2019;t just mean clothes, though today&#x2019;s outfit is cowboy boots, red stockings, and a lacy baby-doll dress, all on a five-foot-eleven-inch body. I mean her. When Alison flashes that gap-toothed smile like she&#x2019;s up to something, you want to be up on it with her. You want to be the one who says the funny line that makes her tip her chin and laugh with nothing held back. And maybe I love her with something like tenderness, because in this large, lonely world, she&#x2019;s the only girl who has ever grabbed my ass.<br> <br>As the bus starts moving and pulls away from campus, the back row breaks into stupid songs and starts churning like a mosh pit. A suspiciously shaped balloon bounces over our heads, and Bryce shouts, &#x201c;Whale condom launched!&#x201d;<br> <br>Male voices chant, Keep it up, keep it up!<br> <br>Poor Mr. Bailey. He&#x2019;s a young teacher, and I think young teachers get hopeful that we&#x2019;ll like them, and we do. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean we won&#x2019;t give them crap. Nothing personal.<br> <br>But Mr. Bailey hasn&#x2019;t looked at us in the same way since the senior prank, like any kid he sees might be one of the hoodlums who trashed his house in a night of pizza and revelry, while he was at the all-weekend civics teacher conference. We didn&#x2019;t trash it that badly and thought he&#x2019;d take it in stride, maybe even see it as a sign that we think he&#x2019;s cool, but he was furious. He doesn&#x2019;t have enough to convict us, only suspect. Pard&#x2019;s done detention but seems to have told nothing. Yes, there was evidence, but it pointed only to Pard, not to Cannon. Or to me. And the guys on the bus think the only secret to keep is trashing his house, so we&#x2019;re safe there, too.<br> <br>Cannon&#x2019;s right. Everything is fine.<br> <br>&#x201c;Keep it down!&#x201d; Mr. Bailey shouts, and the guys give a deflated aww when he snatches the balloon away.<br> <br>Once the bus hits the freeway, Rooster whips out his ukulele, and it&#x2019;s hilarious to see this gigantic redhead with this itty-bitty uke, but for a linebacker, Rooster&#x2019;s playing well. Alison sings some inappropriate lyrics, bodies sway into each other, and people have more fun than they should be having on a bus. Bryce passes me a plastic cup without explaining, and one sip burns all the way down. I ignore Pard&#x2019;s jealous glances.<br> <br>The noise picks up, and there&#x2019;s a crash in the back row. An empty beer bottle rolls down the aisle.<br> <br>So it begins, even before we&#x2019;ve left quaint Canterbury, Connecticut.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pipe down!&#x201d; Mr. Bailey holds his hands like a victim in a stickup, and then, prompting the driver to pull over but not waiting for the bus to park, he grips the seats as he makes his way down the aisle. He traps the bottle under his foot and emits the mighty sigh of a severely put-upon adult. &#x201c;I am this close to turning around.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cookie, curled in the back corner as if he&#x2019;s one of the popular kids (but really just because he&#x2019;s thoroughly baked), says all dreamy-like, &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t ours, man. It was on the bus when we got here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Bailey raises an eyebrow. &#x201c;The driver told me his normal rounds are with kindergartners.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cookie&#x2019;s mouth hangs open before he manages to reply, &#x201c;I love Goldfish.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Bailey gives us all this constipated look, as if he&#x2019;s straining to connect the trashing of his house with the bottle in his hand. He grips the back of Mace&#x2019;s seat and points his nose toward the rowdy back row like he means business. &#x201c;All right. We are going to behave ourselves and not give me any more trouble. I have this.&#x201d; He brandishes the bottle as evidence of our collective sin. &#x201c;And between this and your little prank&#x201d;&#x2014;he glares at Rooster&#x2019;s faintly purple-yellow forehead, like it might be the reason for the dent in his bedroom door (it is)&#x2014;&#x201c;I can get some of you suspended. I mean it. You&#x2019;ve pushed me way too far.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suspended. That can&#x2019;t happen. Not while I&#x2019;m wait-listed at Cornell and the other low-level Ivies. Yes, I have Georgetown in t...</p><h2>Deep Gossip</h2><p>Henry Abelove, literary critic, astute historian, and pioneer in queer studies, offers interdisciplinary views on the connections between politics, culture, and sexuality. Deep Gossip addresses the willful misreading of Freud&#39;s views on homosexuality among American psychoanalysts; reconsiders sexual practice during England&#39;s eighteenth century; assesses the contemporary relevance of Thoreau&#39;s Walden, particularly to queer politics; and traces the emergence of a queer critique of previous approaches to lesbian and gay history. Abelove uncovers the origins of American studies as a scholarly discipline and evaluates the impact of literature - specifically the same-sex eroticism found in works by such writers as James Baldwin, Elizabeth Bishop, Paul Bowles, and Ned Rorem - on the gay liberation movement of the 1970s. The essays gathered in Deep Gossip confirm Henry Abelove&#39;s reputation as one of America&#39;s leading thinkers on the cultural politics of sexuality.</p><p>Henry Abelove is Willbur Fisk Osborne Professor of English and director of the Center for the Humanities at Wesleyan University. He is author of The Evangelist of Desire: John Wesley and the Methodists (1990) and coeditor (with Michele Aina Barale and David M.

From teaching, to playing professionally, to managing a music publishing company, he has experienced a well-rounded view of the music world. Realizing that most students do not aspire to become concert pianists, but rather want to enjoy being able to sit down at a keyboard and play their favorite music, he has taught thousands of students successfully at universities and colleges nationwide. Scott truly believes that anyone can learn to play well enough to have fun and sound good at a piano or keyboard. Just ask one of his students!</p>Book Excerpt #1 <p>Here is some good, and equally true, news. If you want to learn how to play non-classical popular style piano, you simply need to learn a basic set of rules and techniques and you can start sounding fairly hip right away (as in hours or days, not years). Will you want to keep learning and playing and otherwise keep getting better for the next 5 to 10 years? YES! But, you'll be having the time of your life on the way there. Why? Because you'll be playing instead of practicing. </p><p>Now I'm sure you're saying to yourself, "Sounds great, Scott, but how can it be that easy to teach?" Well, the reason playing non-classical piano is so much easier to teach someone is that it removes the "A-Number-1 Top-of-the-List" reason that most people never learn to play classical piano at any level of proficiency. That, my friends, is notation reading. </p><p>You know, getting your hands around a piano is a relatively simple thing to do compared to most other instruments. It's all target practice! Seriously, as long as you get your finger over the right note at the right time, you are good to go. You can't control if the piano is in or out of tune. You don't have to worry about taking a deep enough breath. Pianists don't have to worry about getting their mouths in some correctly contorted position (known as an embouchure) like horn players. Think about poor brass players who's lips get all swollen and puffy and hurt like crazy when they play high notes. Or how about oboe players who must be (at least I know I would be�) concerned about their brains squeezing out their ears when they play. Or how about any of you who have had sons or daughters start out on a reed instrument like a clarinet or saxophone. I mean, a better goose call has yet to be invented than the first week of a reed players musical life. </p><p>In exchange for the extremely difficult task of dealing with a tough instrument, everyone else gets totally bailed out when it comes to note reading. With just a few exceptions (like string players every now and then) all they ever have to read is one note at a time and only in one clef! Must be nice! Think about traditional piano music; multiple notes at one time, in two clefs (which are different), with two hands. It's a brain buster for sure! </p><p>The thing that makes playing piano such a killer is not the playing, it's the note reading. Piano players (or wannabe players) are strange in this way; I bet if I had 100 piano students look at traditional sheet music (that I knew had notation in it tougher than they could read), 95% of them would say "Scott, I can't play that." That is in contrast with the truth of the matter, which is that they should have said "Scott, I can't read that." Those students wouldn't have any idea whether or not they could physically get their hands over the keyboards in such a way as to play what that notation was recording. I'm sure they never got remotely close to testing their physical abilities on a keyboard. That is because they (like the overwhelming majority of failed "lesson takers") never got to be good enough notation readers to even come close to testing their mechanical abilities. </p><p>It may seem like a hair splitting distinction, but it is really a huge issue that you must come to grip with, that being: READING NOTATION DOES NOT EQUAL GOOD PIANO PLAYING. Can both coincide (good reading and good playing)? Sure, and I applaud those who have toiled to a position where that is the case! But two other possibilities are found in abundance as well. One being, great notation readers who can't play their way out of a paper bag. The other being, those that can't read worth a hoot, who are GREAT players. </p><p>It is that last description that is of major intrigue to us in this book. I hope you are all quietly thinking to yourself, "You mean I can learn how to play piano without becoming a great note reader?" The answer is a resounding YES!!! We will have to acquire a very basic amount of notation reading skill. But the extremely difficult task of honing your note reading skills that classical students are required to endure for years and years is totally nonexistent as a requirement to playing non-classical piano. </p><p>In summary, I reiterate that what you will learn in this book is NOT appropriate for use in playing classical style piano. But, always keep in mind the other side of the coin. If you use the rules of classical piano to play non-classical music, you too will be playing incorrectly. Worse yet, you will be doomed to sound like a corny sheet music player, not like a pro. I'll show you how to sound like a pro...</p></p><h2>When Darkness Loves Us: Two Chilling Tales</h2><p>Two chilling tales of psychological horror portray the dark realms of two children who, for different reasons, have lived totally isolated from society and the world outside their homes</p><p></p><h2>Ring In A Teacup: Best Of Betty Neels (Reader&#39;s Choice)</h2><p>Mr. der Linssen, the handsome Dutch doctor, keeps turning up in Lucy&#39;s life, although she fears he does not realize she exists. Reprint.</p><p>Romance readers around the world were sad to note the passing of Betty Neels in June 2001.Her career spanned thirty years, and she continued to write into her ninetieth year.To her millions of fans, Betty epitomized the romance writer.Betty&#x2019;s first book, Sister Peters in Amsterdam,was published in 1969, and she eventually completed 134 books.Her novels offer a reassuring warmth that was very much a part of her own personality.Her spirit and genuine talent live on in all her stories.The sun, already warmer than it should have been for nine o'clock on an August morning, poured through the high, uncurtained windows of the lecture hall at St Norbert's Hospital, highlighting the rows of uniformed figures, sitting according to status, their differently coloured uniform dresses making a cheerful splash of colour against the drab paintwork, their white caps constantly bobbing to and fro as they enjoyed a good gossip before their lecture began&#x2014;all but the two front rows; the night nurses sat there, silently resentful of having to attend a lecture when they should have been on their way to hot baths, unending cups of tea, yesterday's paper kindly saved by a patient, and finally, blissful bed.<br><br>And in the middle of the front row sat student nurse Lucy Prendergast, a small slip of a girl, with mousy hair, pleasing though not pretty features and enormous green eyes, her one claim to beauty. But as she happened to be fast asleep, their devastating glory wasn't in evidence, indeed she looked downright plain; a night of non-stop work on Children's had done nothing to improve her looks.<br><br>She would probably have gone on sleeping, sitting bolt upright on her hard chair, if her neighbours hadn't dug her in the ribs and begged her to stir herself as a small procession of Senior Sister Tutor, her two assistants and a clerk to make notes, trod firmly across the platform and seated themselves and a moment later, nicely timed, the lecturer, whose profound utterances the night nurses had been kept from their beds to hear, came in.<br><br>There was an immediate hush and then a gentle sigh from the rows of upturned faces; it had been taken for granted that he would be elderly, pompous, bald and mumbling, but he was none of these things&#x2014;he was very tall, extremely broad, and possessed of the kind of good looks so often written about and so seldom seen; moreover he was exquisitely dressed and when he replied to their concerted 'good morning, sir,' his voice was deep, slow and made all the more interesting by reason of its slight foreign accent.<br><br>His audience, settling in their seats, sat back to drink in every word and take a good look at him at the same time&#x2014;all except Nurse Prendergast, who hadn't even bothered to open her eyes properly. True, she had risen to her feet when everyone else did, because her good friends on either side of her had dragged her to them, but seated again she dropped off at once and continued to sleep peacefully throughout the lecture, unheeding of the deep voice just above her head, explaining all the finer points of angiitis obliterans and its treatment, and her friends, sharing the quite erroneous idea that the occupants of the first two rows were quite safe from the eyes of the lecturer on the platform, for they believed that he always looked above their heads into the body of the hall, allowed her to sleep on. Everything would have been just fine if he hadn't started asking questions, picking members of his audience at random. When he asked: 'And the result of these tests would be...' his eyes, roaming along the rows of attentive faces before him, came to rest upon Lucy's gently nodding head.<br><br>A ferocious gleam came into his eyes; she could have been looking down into her lap, but he was willing to bet with himself that she wasn't.<br><br>'The nurse in the centre of the first row,' he added softly.<br><br>Lucy, dug savagely in the ribs by her nervous friends, opened her eyes wide and looked straight at him. She was bemused by sleep and had no idea what he had said or what she was supposed to say herself. She stared up at the handsome, bland face above her; she had never seen eyes glitter, but the cold blue ones boring into hers were glittering all right. A wash of bright pink crept slowly over her tired face, but it was a flush of temper rather than a blush of shame; she was peevish from lack of sleep and her resentment was stronger than anything else just at that moment. She said in a clear, controlled voice: 'I didn't hear what you were saying, sir&#x2014;I was asleep.'<br><br>His expression didn't alter, although she had the feeling that he was laughing silently. She added politely, 'I'm sorry, sir,' and sighed with relief as his gaze swept over her head to be caught and held by the eager efforts of a girl Lucy couldn't stand at any price&#x2014;Martha Inskip, the knowall of her set; always ready with the right answers to Sister Tutor's questions, always the one to get the highest marks in written papers, and yet quite incapable of making a patient comfortable in bed&#x2014; The lecturer said almost wearily: 'Yes, Nurse?' and then listened impassively to her perfect answer to the question Lucy had so regrettably not heard.<br><br>He asked more questions after that, but never once did he glance at Lucy, wide-awake now and brooding unhappily about Sister Tutor's reactions. Reactions which reared their ugly heads as the lecture came to a close with the formal leavetaking of the lecturer as he stalked off the platform with Sister Tutor and her attendants trailing him. Her severe back was barely out of sight before the orderly lines of nurses broke up into groups and began to make their way back to their various destinations. Lucy was well down the corridor leading to the maze of passages which would take her to the Nurses' Home when a breathless nurse caught up with her. 'Sister Tutor wants you,' she said urgently, 'in the ante-room.'<br><br>Lucy didn't say a word; she had been pushing her luck and now there was nothing to do about it; she hadn't really believed that she would get off scot free. She crossed the lecture hall and went through the door by the platform into the little room used by the lecturers. There were only two people in it, Sister Tutor and the lecturer, and the former said at once in a voice which held disapproval: 'I will leave you to apologise to Doctor der Linssen, Nurse Prendergast,' and sailed out of the room.<br><br>The doctor stood where he was, looking at her. Presently he asked: 'Your name is Prendergast?' and when she nodded: 'A peculiar name.' Which so incensed her that she said snappily: 'I did say I was sorry.'<br><br>'Oh, yes, indeed. Rest assured that it was not I who insisted on you returning.'<br><br>He looked irritable and tired. She said kindly: 'I expect your pride's hurt, but it doesn't need to be; everyone thought you were smashing, and I would have gone to sleep even if you'd been Michael Caine or Kojak.'<br><br>A kind of spasm shook the doctor's patrician features, but he said merely: 'You are on night duty, Miss&#x2014;er&#x2014;Prendergast.' It wasn't a question.<br><br>'Yes. The children's ward&#x2014;always so busy and just unspeakable last night, and then I had a huge breakfast and it's fatal to sit down afterwards,' and when he made no reply added in a motherly way: 'I expect you're quite nice at home with your wife and children.'<br><br>'I have not as yet either wife or children.' He sounded outraged. 'You speak as though you were a securely married mother of a large family. Are you married, Miss Prendergast?'<br><br>'Me? no&#x2014;I'd be Mrs if I were, and who'd want to marry me? But I've got brothers and sisters, and we had such fun when we were children.'<br><br>His voice was icy. 'You lack respect, young lady, and you are impertinent. You should not be nursing, you should be one of those interfering females who go around telling other people how to lead their lives and assuring them that happiness is just around the corner.'<br><br>She tried not to blush, but she couldn't stop herself; she was engulfed in a red glow, but she looked him in the eye. 'I don't blame you for getting your own back,' she added a sir this time. 'Now we're equal, aren't we?'<br><br>She didn't wait to be dismissed but flew through the door as though she had the devil at her heels, back the way she had come, almost bursting with rage and dislike of him; it took several cups of tea and half an hour in a very hot bath reading the <i>Daily Mirror</i> before she was sufficiently calmed down to go to bed and sleep at last.<br><br>Lucy forgot the whole regrettable business in no time at all; she was rushed off her feet on duty and when she was free she slept soundly like the healthy girl she was, and if, just once or twice, she remembered the good-looking lecturer, she pushed him to the back of her mind; she was no daydreamer&#x2014;besides, he hadn't liked her.<br><br>She had expected a lecture from Sister Tutor, but no word had been said; probably, thought Lucy, she considered that she had been sufficiently rebuked for her behaviour.<br><br>She went home for her nights off at the end of the following week, a quite long journey which she could only afford once a month. The small village outside Beaminster, which wasn't much more than a village itself, was buried in the Dorset hills; it meant going by train to Crewkerne where she was met by her father, Rector of Dedminster and the hamlets of Lodcombe and Twistover, in the shaky old Ford used by every member of the family if they happened to be at home.<br><br>Her father met her at the station, an elderly man with mild blue eyes who had passed on his very ordinary features to her; except for the green eyes, of course, and no one in the family knew where they had come from. He led her out to the car, and after a good deal of poking around coaxed it to start, but once they were bowling sedately towards Beaminster, he embarked on a gentle dissertation about the parish, the delightful weather and the various odds and ends of news about her mother and brothers and sisters.<br><br>Lucy listened with pleasure; he was so restful after the rush and hurry of hospital life, and he was so kind. She had a fleeting memory of the lecturer, who hadn't been kind at all, and then shook her head angrily to get rid of his image, with its handsome features and pale hair.<br><br>The Rectory was a large rambling place, very inconvenient; all passages and odd stairs and small rooms leading from the enormous kitchen, which in an earlier time must have housed a horde of servants. Lucy darted through the back door and found her mother at the kitchen table, hulling strawberries&#x2014;a beautiful woman still, even with five grown-up children, four of whom had inherited her striking good looks, leaving Lucy to be the plain one in the family, although as her mother pointed out often enough, no one else had emerald green eyes.<br><br>Lucy perched on the table and gobbled up strawberries while she answered her mother's questions; they were usually the same, only couched in carefully disguised ways: had Lucy met any nice young men? had she been out? and if by some small chance she had, the young man had to be described down to the last coat button, even though Lucy pointed out that in most cases he was already engaged or had merely asked her out in order to pave the way to an introduction to one of her friends. She had little to tell this time; she was going to save the lecturer for later.<br><br>'Lovely to be home,' she observed contentedly.<br><br>'Who's here?'<br><br>'Kitty and Jerry and Paul, dear. Emma's got her hands full with the twins&#x2014;they've got the measles.'<br><br>Emma was the eldest and married, and both her brothers were engaged, while Kitty was the very new wife of a BOAC pilot, on a visit while he went on a course.<br><br>'Good,' said Lucy. 'What's for dinner?'<br><br>Her parent gave her a loving look; Lucy, so small and slim, had the appetite of a large horse and never put on an ounce.<br><br>'Roast beef, darling, and it's almost ready.'<br><br>It was over Mrs Prendergast's splendidly cooked meal that Lucy told them all about her unfortunate lapse during the lecture.<br><br>'Was he good-looking?' Kitty wanted to know.<br><br>'Oh, very, and very large too&#x2014;not just tall but wide as well; he towered, if you know what I mean, and cold blue eyes that looked through me and the sort of hair that could be either very fair or grey.' She paused to consider. 'Oh, and he had one of those deep, rather gritty voices.'<br><br>Her mother, portioning out trifle, gave her a quick glance. 'But you didn't like him, love?'<br><br>Lucy, strictly brought up as behoved a parson's daughter, answered truthfully and without embarrassment.<br><br>'Well, actually, I did&#x2014;he was smashing. Now if it had been Kitty or Emma...they'd have known what to do, and anyway, he wouldn't have minded them; they're both so pretty.' She sighed. 'But he didn't like me, and why should he, for heaven's sake? Snoring through his rolling periods!'<br><br>'Looks are not everything, Lucilla,' observed her father mildly, who hadn't really been listening and had only caught the bit about being pretty. 'Perhaps a suitable regret for your rudeness in falling asleep, nicely phrased, would have earned his good opinion.'<br><br>Lucy said 'Yes, Father,' meekly, privately of the opinion that it wouldn't have made a scrap of difference if she had gone down on her knees to the wretched man. It was her mother who remarked gently: 'Yes, dear, but you must remember that Lucy has always been an honest child; she spoke her mind and I can't blame her. She should never have had to attend his lecture in the first place.'<br><br>'Then she wouldn't have seen this magnificent specimen of manhood,' said Jerry, reaching for the cheese.<br><br>'Not sweet on him, are you, Sis?' asked Paul slyly, and Lucy being Lucy took his question seriously.<br><br>'Oh, no&#x2014;chalk and cheese, you know. I expect he eats his lunch at Claridges when he's not giving learned advice to someone or other and making pots of money with private patients.'<br><br>'You're being flippant, my dear.' Her father smiled at her.<br><br>'Yes, Father. I'm sure he's a very clever man and probably quite nice to the people he likes&#x2014;anyway, I shan't see him again, shall I?' She spoke cheerfully, conscious of a vague regret. She had, after all, only seen one facet of the man, all the others might be something quite different.</p><h2>The Cigar - Moments of Pleasure</h2><p>This work is based on a fundamental fascination with cigars and everything to do with them: their history, production, how you enjoy them and, not least, the people who smoke them.

Please send me some information on whales.&#34; Mr. Blueberry answers at once, pointing out that whales live in salt water, not in ponds, so it can&#39;t be a whale. But Emily believes in her whale and replies that she is putting salt into the pond every day before breakfast and that she has seen the whale smile. After several letters, Mr. Blueberry explains more forcibly that a whale cannot live in Emily&#39;s pond and that whales are migratory. Emily then reports that her whale has at last become migratory again because of Mr. Blueberry&#39;s letter and has left the pond. She is sad. But in her last letter, she has a happy surprise to tell Mr. Blueberry, and all is well. Emily&#39;s very real concern for her whale comes through most convincingly in this delightfully imaginative, childlike text. Children everywhere will sympathize with Emily, and, like her, will learn some basic facts about these great creatures from Mr. Blueberry&#39;s letters. Simon James&#39;s full-color illustrations are a perfect accompaniment to this unusual book that gives small children a gentle introduction to the world of nature.</p><p>Before entering art college where he specialized in graphics, <b>Simon James</b> held many different jobs, ranging from policeman to farm worker. He lives in Devon, England, now and has been adopted as artist in residence by a local school, where he teaches children, as he puts it, "how to have fun making a mess and expressing something at the same time." His previous book, <i>Sally and the Limpet,</i> features an endearing little girl who learns a subtle lesson about nature and the environment.PreSchool-Grade 1-- It is summer, and Emily discovers that a whale is living in the pond in her yard. Eager to learn more about this amazing animal, she writes a series of letters to her teacher, Mr. Blueberry, asking for information about whales and their habits. The humor of the situation lies in Mr. Blueberry's replies. He sends Emily some details, but he is also quite adamant that whatever is in her pond is not a whale since they live in salt water. Nevertheless, both Emily and readers know that indeed there is a whale in the pond, and the proof is the amusing, full-page watercolor cartoons. Emily shares her letters with the whale, who, after hearing about his species' migratory habits, leaves the pond to return to the ocean. (How he does this is not explained.) At first, Emily is saddened at her loss, but a chance meeting with Arthur on the beach gives her the opportunity to say goodbye. This story is a nice blend of fantasy and reality with a smattering of facts. The large print and simple vocabulary make it appropriate for beginning readers. --Laura Culberg, Harold Washington Library Center, Chicago<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Santa&#39;s North Pole Cookbook: Classic Christmas Recipes from Saint Nicholas Himself</h2><p>In this one-of-a-kind Christmas cookbook, Saint Nicholas himself invites readers to pull up their chairs to his dining table at the North Pole and enjoy a bounty of his most cherished holiday recipes.

A better question might be, who knows the real history of this wonderful confection?</p><p>Chocolate is extracted from the beans of the tropical cacao tree, and archaeologists searching old ruins have determined that the Mayans enjoyed drinks over twenty-five hundred years ago. They loved the beverage so much that many grew cacao trees in the gardens of their homes.</p><p>The Aztecs called this substance chocolatl and enjoyed it in both solid and liquid forms. Chocolatl was so much in demand that Aztec merchants often used it for currency.</p><p>Christopher Columbus brought cacao beans back to Spain during his first new World explorations, but it may have been explorer Hern�n Cort�s who discovered how to produce a drink sweet enough to enrapture members of the Spanish aristocracy by mixing sugarcane juice with liquefied cacao beans. For most of the 1500s, "hot chocolate" was a drink enjoyed almost exclusively in Spain. Explorers for other European nations had no idea what cacao/chocolate was. One legend has it that a British pirate who captured a Spanish barge laden with cacao beans burned the ship and its cargo because he mistook the beans for dried animal droppings.</p><p>But Spain couldn't keep its tasty secret forever, and in the 1600s virtually every country in Europe went chocolate-intensive, drinking it with glee. Eating chocolate as a snack came much later. The first modern chocolate bar wasn't produced until the 1840s, when an English manufacturer invented the treat that would satisfy everyone's sweet tooth for generations to come.</p><p>Still, at the North Pole we like to honor Spain's pioneering efforts in what would become modern chocolate consumption. So if you and your family traditionally enjoy cups of hot chocolate as part of your holiday merriment, I gladly recommend this recipe based on the traditional Spanish beverage.</p><p><b>Lars Says:</b> &#x201c;Once again, you'll notice I've substituted a modern ingredient: They didn't have vanilla instant pudding back in medieval Spain. Even so, this is one of the richest chocolate drinks you'll ever enjoy. One delicious cup should be plenty for anyone, even the most devout lover of chocolate!&#x201d;</p><ul><li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li><li>4 ozs.

You may be amazed that such a ferocious warrior joined my gift-giving mission, but this only proves that anyone can be changed for the better by belief in the generosity of spirit that defines the Christmas season. Much like Attila, mushroom species in North America are edible; several varieties are incredibly poisonous. We know that mushrooms were being used for medicinal purposes as far back as 11,000 B.C., and that five thousand years ago Egyptian pharaohs loved mushrooms so much that they made it illegal for their nonroyal subjects to eat them.</p><p>Originally from Asia Minor, Attila and his tribe gradually swept into what would eventually be called Europe, fighting and pillaging all along the way. Mushrooms were handy food for warriors; they could be dried, carried in packs, and used as a tasty ingredient in campfire stews. Even after he stopped fighting and joined me, Attila still loved mushrooms. Sausage and cheese are his other favorite foods, so one afternoon at the North Pole, Lars combined these ingredients into a spicy appetizer that will be a highlight of your holiday season.</p><p><b>Lars Says:</b> &#x201c;If these stuffed mushrooms can satisfy Attila's hearty appetite, then your family and guests are sure to love them, too. Figure two to three mushrooms per person. I use Muenster cheese, but if you prefer another type of cheese, that's fine.&#x201d;</p><p></p><ul>3 tbsp. butter</ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>1 tbsp. vegetable oil</li><li>� onion, diced</li><li>1 tomato, diced</li><li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li><li>16 to 18 large white mushrooms, stems removed and minced</li><li>salt and pepper</li><li>� lb. bulk sausage (ground without casing)</li><li>1 tsp. ground caraway seeds</li><li>16 to 18 thin slices of Muenster cheese to cover the mushroom caps</li></ul><p></p><p>1.Preheat your oven to 375�F.</p><p>2. In a medium skillet, melt 1 tbsp. of the butter with the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the onion, tomato, and garlic with some of the minced mushroom stem. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is soft. Add the sausage and ground caraway seed. Cook over medium heat, breaking up the sausage with the side of a spoon, until the sausage is well done. Remove from the heat and cool slightly.</p><p>3. Place the mushroom caps stem side up on an ungreased cookie sheet. Fill the hollow created by removing the stems with enough of the sausage mixture to create a small mound.</p><p>4. Melt the remaining 2 tbsp. of butter and drizzle evenly over the mushrooms and filling. Place a thin slice of Muenster cheese big enough to fully cover the filling on top of each mushroom.</p><p>5. Place the cookie sheet in the oven, and cook the mushroom for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the cheese has fully melted. Remove from the oven and let cool for 2 minutes before serving. If Attila happens to be at your party, don't let him eat all the stuffed mushrooms himself.</p><p><b>Buche de Noel</b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b> (Christmas Log Cake)</b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><ul>The Cake:<li>� cup granulated sugar</li><li>4 eggs, separated</li><li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li><li>Pinch of cream of tartar</li><li>� cup cake flour, sifted</li></ul><p></p><p>(To make chocolate cake, add � cup alkalized cocoa powder and sift it with the cake flour.

Whisk the espresso powder and rum into the buttercream.)</p><p>1. Preheat oven to 375�F. Grease the bottom of a 15 by 10-inch baking pan and line with parchment paper; set aside.</p><p>2. Remove 2 tbsp. of the sugar from the � cup called for in this recipe and set aside. In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks and the remaining sugar until blended. Add the vanilla and beat until thoroughly mixed.</p><p>3. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites and the cream of tartar until the mixture holds soft peaks when the beaters are lifted. Add the reserved 2 tbsp. sugar and beat until the egg whites are glossy and hold stiff peaks.</p><p>4. In two additions, gently fold the flour into the egg yolk mixture. Add one-quarter of the beaten egg whites. Then fold in the remaining egg whites. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly into the corners. Bake for 15 minutes.</p><p>5. While the cake is baking, spread a dish towel flat on your kitchen counter. Lay a piece of parchment paper slightly larger than the cake on top of the towel. Sprinkle the paper with sugar.</p><p>6. When the cake is done, invert it onto the paper on top of the towel, lining up the cake with the sides of the paper as closely as you can. Then gently peel off the parchment. Beginning at one shorter end of the cake, slowly roll up the cake with the new parchment paper still inside. Wrap the dish towel around the cake, place it on a wire rack, and let cool.</p><p>7. While the cake is cooling, make the frosting: Using an electric mixer, blend the egg whites and sugar in a large bowl. Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water and whisk gently until the sugar has dissolved and the egg whites are hot. Attach the bowl to the mixer and whip with the whisk on medium speed until cooled.</p><p>8. Switch to the paddle attachment and beat in the softened butter. Continue beating until the buttercream is smooth. Then add the semisweet and unsweetened chocolate pieces and whisk until melted and smooth.</p><p>9.When the cake has completely cooked, unroll it. Spread the frosting evenly over the top. Roll the cake up again, removing the parchment paper from the bottom as you roll. Cover the cake loosely and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</p><p>10. Just before serving, you can do some things to lend an even more yule log-like appearance to the cake. For instance, spread leftover frosting over the sides, then run the tines of a fork over the frosting to create the illusion of bark. Dust the top of the cake with powdered sugar to symbolize snow and the winter solstice. Cut off a small piece at an angle from one end of the &#x201c;log&#x201d; and attach it to the side with some frosting to resemble a bough.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Godforsaken Idaho: Stories</h2><p><p><b>Winner of the 2014 PEN/Robert W.

From &#x201c;The First Several Hundred Years Following My Death,&#x201d; an absurd, profound vision of a hellish heaven, to "Winter Elders," in which missionaries calmly and relentlessly pursue a man who has left the fold, these nine stories illuminate the articles of faith that make us human. </p> <p>The concluding triptych tackles the legends and legacy of Mormonism head-on, culminating in "Diviner," a seriocomic portrait of the young Joseph Smith, back when he was not yet the founder of a religion but a man hired to find buried treasure. <i>Godforsaken Idaho</i> is an indelible collection by the writer you need to read next.</p></p><p><p><b>A Q&amp;A with Shawn Vestal and Jess Walter</b></p> <strong>Shawn Vestal </strong>has worked for many years as a journalist and editor at <em>The Spokesman-Review</em> in Spokane. His stories have appeared in <em>McSweeney's</em> and <em>Tin House</em>, among many other publications, and his new collection is <em>Godforsaken Idaho</em>. <br><br><strong>Jess Walter</strong> is the author of six novels, one book of short fiction, and a new story collection, <em>We Live in Water</em>. His most recent novel, <em>Beautiful Ruins</em>, was named the best book of 2012 by <em>Esquire</em> and NPR&#x2019;s <em>Fresh Air</em>. <br><br><strong>JW:</strong> Let&#x2019;s start with the title, <em>Godforsaken Idaho</em>. You grew up in Southern Idaho. How much does the setting play a part in these stories, and in you as a writer? <br><strong>SV: </strong>Idaho is so deeply a part of me that I probably don&#x2019;t even recognize the ways it emerges in my writing. I never set out to write about the state in any direct way--but on some level, I am probably always writing about Idaho, or my childhood and family and everything else that is tied up in Idaho for me. It&#x2019;s a place I love and a place that drives me crazy and, most of all, a place that I know. <br><br><strong>JW: </strong>&#x201c;The First Several Hundred Years Following My Death&#x201d; is such a funny, original, matter-of-fact depiction of the banality of afterlife. How did that story come about? <br><strong>SV:</strong> I wrote the first lines with no idea of what might lie behind them: &#x201c;The food is excellent. The lines are never long. There&#x2019;s nothing to do with your hands. These are the first things I told my son. Then we don&#x2019;t talk again for something like 200 years.&#x201d; I think the voice and the story&#x2019;s conceit were built into those lines, and I spent a lot of time extracting the story from them. <br><br><strong>JW:</strong> &#x201c;About as Fast as This Car Will Go&#x201d; has flashes of autobiography. What do you do when you a story approaches the details of your own life? <br><strong>SV:</strong> I usually recognize it only after the fact, strange as that may seem given how obvious some of the connections are. I never set out to write about my life, even indirectly. But I always find, through the roundabout operation of the imagination, that I&#x2019;ve returned to the same few preoccupations: absent fathers, criminal fathers, regretful fathers--they&#x2019;re everywhere in my fiction. Not much mystery there: My own father went to jail, and then prison, when I was a boy. Yet nothing that happens in &#x201c;About as Fast&#x201d; happened to me. My father committed different crimes, and my family situation is much, much different, and I--crucially, I&#x2019;d like to think--did not follow him into a life of crime. So far. <br><br><strong>JW:</strong> These stories often deal with the mythology and hypocrisy of religion, even its mystery. How did your lapsed Mormon faith figure in these stories? <br><strong>SV:</strong> More in the lapse than the faith, probably. Like a lot of people who have left a religion, probably, I was focused for a long time on the hypocrisy of the faithful and the failures of religion. But that is such a standard, clich�d pose--as if only the faithful are hypocritical or ignorant or deluded or weak. I wanted to write about doubters, denouncers, heretics. Though I have left the church, Mormonism is my heritage, and using the materials of Mormonism&#x2019;s stories to write new ones--even stories that might seem heretical to some--became a way of keeping possession of this heritage.Shawn Vestal is an Eastern Washington University alumnus.

In 1973 she was appointed by Richard Nixon to chair the US Atomic Energy Commission, and was the first and only woman to do so.<br><br> LOU GUZZO is one of the most prolific writers of his day. Because of his penchant for writing, friends have dubbed Guzzo as a modern-day ''Grandpa Moses of Literature.''Some of the authors' major premises are that nuclear power is a safe and cheap source of energy; that acid rain is a vastly exaggerated problem; that chemical pesticides are not as dangerous as they have been made out to be; and that worry over the ozone hole is just an environmental scare tactic. Ray, a marine biologist, former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, and Washington's governor when Mount St. Helens erupted, has a long history of offending conservationists, and most of this book, written with Guzzo, a writer and adviser to Ray during her governorship, is a recitation of statistics and research studies that prove her points. This recitation makes the book tedious, and it is troubling that there are no footnotes or bibliography. A researcher could spend weeks trying to search out the studies mentioned.

The purpose of such a union offorces, as it is concisely - almost surgically exposed by Halsell, is the return to Israeli control of all of Palestine and the rebuilding of the Temple ofJerusalem. For the religious zionist, such a redemption of the land is prerequisite to Messiah's first coming. For the American fundamentalist, it is prerequisite to Armageddon and Messiah's second coming. Reclamation and/or Armageddon are seen, therefore, as events most earnestly to be desired. Armageddon, at least by the fundamentalists, is also seen as nuclear and imminent, waiting only for proper orchestration from American political leaders. Halsell's comprehensive index, her scholarly citation of every quote and assertion, her deliberate simplicity of style and careful summations at the conclusion of each chapter, raise this work to the level of documentary. Indeed, her presentation of herself as having been reared fundamentalist is so delivered as to lay aside any possibility of the material's being interpretive; it is simply presented. Readers are left to draw their own conclusions. This is a startling book rendered with exquisite carefulness by a very able and experienced writer. Like the writer, however, a respectful reviewer too must suggest that any conclusions from the material presented should be drawn by the reader. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i>Armageddon theology of the New Christian Rightpropagated by certain TV evangelists, including possible presidential candidate Pat Robertson and politically active Jerry Falwell, along with Hal Lindsey's widely read The Late Great Planet Earthis reaching an estimated 60 million Americans, according to born-again Christian journalist Halsell (Soul Sister. During two of Falwell's Holy Land tours, the author interviewed fundamentalist members, all of whom believed that we must fulfill the biblical prophecy of fighting World War III preparatory to Christ's Second Coming. Most disquieting, if one credits Halsell's evidence and conclusions, is her discussion of an alliance of the New Christian Right and militant Zionists who share a common belief and enthusiasm for a global holocaust. Alarming, too, is the extent of the political influence of these evangelists, the Israeli lobby and PACs, along with the author's assertion that Reagan's policies regarding military spending and disarmament are largely subject to his alleged belief in the inevitability of a God-willed nuclear war. 15,000 first printing; $15,000 ad/promo; author tour.

Tender, frequently hilarious, and always electrifying, <i>Dog Run Moon</i> announces the arrival of a bold new talent writing deep in the American grain.<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Dog Run Moon</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[An] excellent first book of stories . . . One of the great things about <i>Dog Run Moon</i> is how resilient and funny [the characters] are. They&#x2019;re at the end of their ropes, but they can still howl about the joy and pain each day brings, as if the young Levon Helm were singing their stories. . . . This is Thomas McGuane territory, and also that of writers like Joy Williams and Jim Harrison.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Wink is definitely not a writer of half measures; each of these stories demonstrates his ability to lay life bare. A significant collection highly deserving of the spotlight.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal </i>(starred review)</b><br><br>&#x201c;Myth and history color these highly satisfying fictions about the way men and women struggle to shape their lives.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews </i>(starred review)</b><br><br>&#x201c;The perils of work and the weight of bequeathal fuel these stories, and each one holds a lasting, unshakable image. Sometimes grace is bestowed upon the characters in a sidewindering, not altogether fabulous fashion; sometimes it&#x2019;s not bestowed at all. Callan Wink seems to know well the stratagems and delusions of men&#x2019;s hearts. He also seems born and bred to short-story mastery.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Joy Williams, author of <i>The Visiting Privilege</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Callan Wink&#x2019;s debut is impressive indeed. Fine, old-fashioned, rich and juicy fiction. Weeks later I&#x2019;m still living with the characters.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Jim Harrison, author of <i>Legends of the Fall</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Callan Wink&#x2019;s fresh, urgent stories have an energy and propulsion that set them well apart from the cerebral finger painting of so much literary fiction. Here is a writer with a great big horizon.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Thomas McGuane, author of <i>Crow Fair<br></i></b><br> &#x201c;Callan Wink&#x2019;s stories remind me of expertly tied trout flies&#x2014;beautifully crafted, true to reality, and barbed. What a fine young writer.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Ron Rash, author of <i>Above the Waterfall<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;As in all the best collections, each and every story in <i>Dog Run Moon</i> sings in the essential registers of love and death, work and nature. Callan Wink has the wisdom to write only of the things that matter, and the talent to make these stories as fresh as the literary headwaters from which they come.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Smith Henderson, author of <i>Fourth of July Creek</i></b></p><p><b>Callan Wink</b> was born in Michigan in 1984. He lives in Livingston, Montana, where he is a fly-fishing guide on the Yellowstone River. He is the recipient of an NEA Creative Writing Fellowship and a Stegner Fellowship at Stanford University. His work has been published in <i>The New Yorker, Granta, Men&#x2019;s Journal, </i>and <i>The Best American Short Stories</i>.Dog Run Moon<br><br>Sid was a nude sleeper. Had been ever since he was a little kid. To him, wearing clothes to bed seemed strangely redundant, like wearing underwear inside your underwear or something. Sid had slept in the nude every night of his adult life and that was why, now, he was running barefoot and bare-assed across the sharp sandstone rimrock far above the lights of town. It was after two in the morning, a clear, cool, early June night with the wobbly gibbous moon up high and bright so he could see the train yard below&#x2014;-the crisscrossing rails, a huge haphazard pile of old ties, the incinerator stack. He was sweating but he knew once he could run no more the cold would start to find its way in. After that he didn&#x2019;t know what would happen.<br> The dog was padding along tirelessly, sometimes at Sid&#x2019;s side, sometimes ranging out and quartering back sharply, his nose up to the wind trying to cut bird scent. Not for the first time in his life Sid found himself envying a dog. Its fur. Its thick foot&nbsp; pads. A simple untroubled existence of sleeping, eating, running, fucking occasionally if you still had the parts, not worrying about it if you didn&#x2019;t. Even in his current predicament Sid couldn&#x2019;t help but admire the dog. A magnificent bird dog for broken country such as this, no two ways about it. Sid kept going, hobbling, feeling the sharp rimrock make raw hamburger out of the soles of his feet. When he turned he could see smears of his blood on the flat rock shining black under the moon. And then, the shafts of headlights stabbing the jutting sandstone outcroppings. He could hear the shouts of Montana Bob and Charlie Chaplin as they piloted their ATV over the rough ground.<br> Sid hadn&#x2019;t stolen the dog. He&#x2019;d liberated the dog. He firmly believed this and this belief was the fundamental basis for the disagreement between himself and Montana Bob. Montana Bob thought ownership meant simple possession. Sid thought otherwise. He&#x2019;d been in town for two months and his path to and from work took him twice daily through the alley. The dog would follow his passing through the chain--link and Sid would whistle and the dog would raise its ears without getting up.<br> Sid worked at a sawmill that processed logs brought down from the mountains. The logs came in massive and rough, smelling like moss and the dark places where snow lingers into July. They entered one end of a screeching hot pole building, met the saw, and came out the other side, flat and white and bleeding pitch into the red--dirt lumberyard. The men that worked the logs and the saw were Mexicans mostly, wide, sweating men who worked in dirty white tank tops, their inner arms scabbed and raw from wrestling rough--barked logs. They spoke their language to each other and Sid did not know them. He kept to himself and did his work. He was a scrap man. All day he took cast--off pieces of aspen and pine, and cut and stapled them into pallets that were eventually piled with boards to be shipped out. All day he measured and sawed and stapled. His hands were pitch--stained and splintered. All day his mind ran laps, and after work he walked back through the alley, whistled at the dog on his way by, and drank three glasses of water in quick succession, standing at the kitchen sink in the empty trailer he rented by the month and hadn&#x2019;t bothered to furnish. Even with the windows open the trailer smelled like a hot closet full of unwashed clothing, and Sid couldn&#x2019;t stand being there unless he was asleep.<br> In the evenings he drove. Sometimes over to the next town, sometimes for hours until he ended up in the river valley at the base of the mountains where it was always ten degrees cooler. She lived there now and he knew her house but he never drove by. He couldn&#x2019;t bear the thought of her looking out from her kitchen window to see his truck moving slowly down the street. He could imagine how his face would look to her. Sun--dark. Gaunt. Too sharp down the middle like it was creased. Sometimes he got a milkshake at the diner and nursed it for the drive. No matter where he drove, he took the same way back, the route that took him around front of the house with the dog. The house where the east--facing windows were covered with tinfoil and Sid had never seen anyone outside.<br> At the mill one afternoon a full pallet of eight--inch--by--twelve--foot boards broke free of the loader and crushed the legs of one of the Mexicans who had been standing by the truck, waiting to tighten the straps. Sid, eating his lunch, saw the whole thing, heard the man&#x2019;s hoarse screams over the shriek of the saw until the saw was silenced, and then it was just the man, pinned to the ground and writhing, his eyes bulging, with sawdust coating the sweat on his bare arms.<br> That evening, Sid drove straight to her house, still in his work clothes. When he got there her car was in the driveway and there was a pickup truck parked behind it. Sid pulled in sharply and got out, not bothering to shut his door behind him. He was striding fast, halfway up to her porch, before he noticed the dried smears of blood on his pant legs and boots. At the mill, he and everyone else had rushed to the man, frantically teaming up to move the heavy boards from his legs. There had been blood everywhere, making the sawdust dark, making the boards slick and red and hard to hold. Now, standing in her front lawn, he looked down at his hands. He tried to clean out the rust--colored crescents under his fingernails, tried to rub the pine pitch mixed with dried blood from the creases in his palms. He was rubbing his hands frantically on his stained jeans, when he saw movement in the curtains over the kitchen window. And then he ran, sliding into the open door of his truck, spinning gravel up onto vehicles in front of him as he backed out at full speed.<br> Sid&#x2019;s route home took him past the house with the dog, and, as usual, there was no sign of life outside. The truck that was often parked in front of the house was gone. Sid passed slowly and then turned around. He thought about it for a minute and then pulled over and let his truck idle. He went around back where the dog was lying on a pile of dirty straw, chained to a sagging picnic table. The dog didn&#x2019;t bark, didn&#x2019;t even get up, just watched Sid with its muzzle resting on its front paws. Sid unhooked the chain from the dog&#x2019;s collar, and when he turned to leave, the dog followed him to his truck, jumped in, and sat on the bench seat, leaning forward with his nose smudging the windshield. Sid drove up to the flat, windswept bench above town and let the dog run. In the hour before it got dark they put up three coveys of Huns and two sharp--tails, the dog moving through clumps of sagebrush and cheatgrass, working against the wind like some beautifully engineered piece of machinery performing perfectly the one, the only, task to which it was suited.<br> Sid was afraid of Montana Bob. As he ran he could feel the fear lodged somewhere up under his sternum, a sharp little stab of something like pain with each inhaled breath. It was a healthy thing, his fear of Montana Bob. You should be afraid, Sid, he thought. You should be afraid of Montana Bob like you should be afraid of a grizzly bear, a loose dog foaming at the mouth, anything nearsighted and sick and unpredictable. Sid stopped behind the wind--twisted limbs of a pi�on pine and listened. He could hear the low growl of the ATV coming behind him and then the different, softer sound of the engine idling, stopped, no doubt, so that Montana Bob and Charlie Chaplin could branch out on foot to look for his sign. Sid was above them and he could see the shapes of their shadows, tall and angular, moving across the headlights, cloaked in swirling motes of red dust.<br> &#x201c;I know who you are, Sid. I know it&#x2019;s you out there. We&#x2019;re still out here, too.&#x201d;<br> Montana Bob&#x2019;s voice came up to him, reverberating off the rock.<br> &#x201c;You got the dog and I think that is a damn stupid reason to go through all this trouble. I got Charlie Chaplin here with me. He too thinks this is a lot of stupidness just for a damn dog. Also, he has a big goddamn pistol. I bet your feet hurt something fierce. You&#x2019;re bleeding like a stuck hog all over this lizard rock and me an&#x2019; Charlie Chaplin are going to drive right up on you before long. We will. Also, you were a big damn fool to run out the back door like that. Charlie saw your naked ass. We were just coming for the dog. You can&#x2019;t argue my right to it. You have that what belongs to me. You catch up that dog and bring it down to me. Also, hell. You know what? We&#x2019;ll even give you a ride back down into town. We will.&#x201d;<br> Sid started out again, moving up and away from the voices and lights. He found a long piece of slickrock that stretched out farther than he could see into the darkness and he ran. He could hear the rough whisper of the dog&#x2019;s pads on the rock, the click of its nails. The dog&#x2019;s coat shone in the moonlight; what was black in sunlight became purple--blue, what was normally white now glowed like mother--of--pearl.<br> Would Montana Bob do as he said? Let Sid go if he came down with the dog? Sid was unsure but he thought not. The small oblong little organ of fear under Sid&#x2019;s sternum pulsed each time his feet slapped the rock. He kept going. The moon overhead was a lopsided and misshapen orb that at any moment might lose its tenuous position and break upon the rocks. That might be a good thing. A landscape of blackness into which he could melt.<br> The dog had been his for a week when Montana Bob found him out. Sid was in the Mint having a happy--hour beer before heading home, and he&#x2019;d left the dog in the truck. He had his back to the door and as soon as the two men came in he had a bad feeling. The bar was pretty much empty but they sat right next to him, one on each side. Plenty of stools all up and down the bar but they came and crowded in on him. The big one wore a sweat--stained summer Stetson with a ragged rooster pheasant tail feather sticking out of the hatband. His hair was shaggy and flared out from the hat brim. He wore a leather vest with nothing underneath it save a mangy pelt of thick blue--black hair. His companion was considerably smaller and extremely fair skinned, nearly bald except for a few blond strands grown long on one side and then combed over. He wore a button--up Oxford shirt and corduroy pants. Sperry Top--Siders. On his belt he had a large knife in a sheath, its handle made of a pale--yellow plastic that was supposed to look like bone. They ordered beers, and when the beers arrived the big man in the hat drank deeply, and then leaned toward Sid, a pale scum of suds covering his upper lip.<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe in beating the bush.&#x201d;<br> Sid picked at a loose corner on the label of his bottle of beer. He thought about bolting, just getting up like he was going to make his way to the bathroom and then sliding right out the back.<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t beat the bush so I&#x2019;m going to get right down to the tacks. I believe I recognize a familiar dog in that blue Chevy out front and also since you&#x2019;re about the only one in here I figure that&#x2019;s your vehicle so I figure that I&#x2019;ll need to ask you where you happened to come across that dog.&#x201d;<br> The man pushed his hat back on his head and swiveled on his stool to face Sid. He smiled.<br> &#x201c;Also, I&#x2019;m Montana Bob.&#x201d; He extended his hand&#x2014;-which Sid shook, not knowing what else to do&#x2014;-and nodded toward his companion seated on Sid&#x2019;s other side.<br> &#x201c;And that&#x2019;s Charlie Chaplin. Shake his hand.&#x201d;<br> Sid turned and shook Charlie Chaplin&#x2019;s pale proffered hand.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a local businessman and Charlie Chaplin is my accountant. Also, he provides counsel to me in matters of legal concern.&#x201d;<br> Sid considered Charlie Chaplin and when their eyes met he felt something skittering and cold move down his spine. Montana Bob was the bigger man, menacing even, with large bare arms and small pieces of pointed silver at the tips of his boots, but it was this one, small and waxen and pale, who made Sid shift uncomfortably.<br> Sid found himself speaking, too quickly, his voice high.<br> &#x201c;I picked up that dog at the shelter. Bought and paid for. Got him his shots, rabies, distemper, all that. I got the paperwork in the truck. They said at the shelter that he was a canine of misfortunate past. Meaning his old owner used to stomp him. Kind of a mutt but he seems loyal. Likes to fetch the tennis ball. My kids are crazy about him.&#x201d;<br> Montana Bob nodded as Sid spoke. Charlie Chaplin nodded too. Montana Bob motioned the bartender down to them and ordered another beer for himself and Charlie Chaplin.<br> &#x201c;Two more. Also, a large pitcher of ice water. No ice.&#x201d;<br> The bartender went away and Montana Bob spoke to Sid&#x2019;s reflection in the mirrored bar back.<br> &#x201c;Likes to fetch the tennis ball does he? Well, I&#x2019;ll be. Did you know that that dog was given to me by a Frenchman? The dog is a French Brittany spaniel and he comes from France. Born in France of royal French Brittany stock. Also, that dog was a gift from a French count. Guy St. Vrain made me a present of that dog when it was just a pup in payment for services rendered by yours truly. You don&#x2019;t know Guy St. Vrain but that doesn&#x2019;t matter. That&#x2019;s how he likes it. He&#x2019;s in the movie business. Also, he&#x2019;s in the dog business.&#x201d;<br> The bartender came with the pitcher of water, and Montana Bob took off his hat and set it on the bar top. He poured half the pitcher into the hat and then replaced it on his head, the water streaming down his face and neck, matting the thick shiny hair on his chest.<br> &#x201c;You stole my fucking dog.&#x201d; He was still looking at Sid through his reflection in the bar mirror. &#x201c;Also, I had a hot and dusty day out on the trail and I come here for a drink only to find my possession in someone else&#x2019;s egg basket.&#x201d;<br> In the mirror Sid saw his hands go up, saw his shoulders shrug.<br> &#x201c;The shelter. I don&#x2019;t know anything about any of this.&#x201d;<br> He slid from the stool and caught the bartender&#x2019;s eye.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take one more. Be right back. Gotta take a leak.&#x201d;<br> In the bathroom he ran the water and splashed some on his face. He had his keys in his hand when he hit the door and then he was out in the last evening rays of sun, firing the truck, the dog standing anxiously with its front paws on the dash. Sid drove without looking back. He drove all the way down the river road and let the dog out. He walked a path through the thickets of tamarisk and Russian olive and when he stopped, the dog perched delicately at the water&#x2019;s edge, standing on a rock, lapping up the muddy red water. Before Sid had burst through the bar doors to start his truck he&#x2019;d glimpsed the bar room&#x2014;-Montana Bob sitting astride his stool like a swayback steed. Charlie Chaplin up standing in front of the jukebox. He was flipping the discs as if looking for a particular track, a song whose name he couldn&#x2019;t remember or one whose tune existed solely in his head.<br> Sid had no clear idea where he was heading. It was a strange mode of navigation, more like divination, taking the smoothest path through a shattered nightscape of jumbled rock&#x2014;-watching for the wicked gleam of prickly pear and jagged cones from the pi�on pines. If he turned he could still see the shafts of light from his pursuer&#x2019;s ATV, and he thought about circling around back toward town. The problem was the dog. Sid would have to cut a wide path around to keep the dog from straying close to the lights...</p><h2>Curse in Reverse</h2><p>Opening their home to an old witch who is in need of shelter, a kind and compassionate couple, who long for a child of their own, is rewarded with &#34;The Curse of the One-Armed Man,&#34; which leads to a magical surprise!</p><p><b>Tom Coppinger</b> has been entranced by Celtic fairy tales and tales by the Brothers Grimm ever since he was a child. He lives with his wife and two sons in County Kildare, Ireland. This is his picture book debut.Kindergarten-Grade 2-Agnezza the Witch comes to the town of Humburg on a cold winter night looking for shelter. She is turned away first by an innkeeper and then by a wealthy landowner, and she curses each of them as she leaves. She is then welcomed in by a poor couple who feed her and even give her their own bed for the night. To their surprise, they, too, receive a curse upon her departure. They watch in horror as the other two curses are fulfilled, and their lives are filled with fear and trepidation as they anticipate their turn. When Agnezza returns, she explains that their curse was "a curse in reverse," and that if they look at the changes in their lives, they will see that they have actually received a blessing. The plot is thin and predictable, and the attempts at humor are strained. The theme of kindness rewarded is handled far more effectively in many other stories, including Joanna Cole's Bony-Legs (S &amp; S, 1984), also illustrated by Zimmer. In Curse, the artist's pen, ink, and watercolor illustrations are stylistically reminiscent of Edward Gorey's work in their settings and landscapes, although the people are cartoonlike.

Busy people fail to manage their time efficiently for the same reasons the poor and those maxed out on credit cards fail to manage their money. The dynamics of scarcity reveal why dieters find it hard to resist temptation, why students and busy executives mismanage their time, and why the same sugarcane farmers are smarter after harvest than before.</p><p>Once we start thinking in terms of scarcity, the problems of modern life come into sharper focus, and <i>Scarcity</i> reveals not only how it leads us astray but also how individuals and organizations can better manage scarcity for greater satisfaction and success.</p></p><p><p>Sendhil Mullainathan, a professor of economics at Harvard University, is a recipient of a MacArthur Foundation "genius grant" and conducts research on development economics, behavioral economics, and corporate finance.

The Canton, Ohio, native was eighteen when he enlisted, a decision that would take him with the US Army from training across the United States and Britain to combat with the 84th Infantry Division in the Battle of the Bulge. <i>Home Front to Battlefront</i> is the tale of a foot soldier who finds himself thrust into a world where he and his unit grapple with the horrors of combat, the idiocies of bureaucracy, and the oddities of life back home&#x2014;all in the same day. The book is based on Carl&#x2019;s personal letters, his recollections and those of the people he served beside, official military history, private papers, and more.<br><br><i>Home Front to Battlefront</i> contributes the rich details of one soldier&#x2019;s experience to the broader literature on World War II. Lavin&#x2019;s adventures, in turn disarming and sobering, will appeal to general readers, veterans, educators, and students of the war. As a history, the book offers insight into the wartime career of a Jewish Ohioan in the military, from enlistment to training through overseas deployment. As a biography, it reflects the emotions and the role of the individual in a total war effort that is all too often thought of as a machine war in which human soldiers were merely interchangeable cogs.</p></p><p><p><b>Frank Lavin</b> is the son of Carl Lavin.

She lives in Orlando, Florida.The Life Intended <br> <br>One<br> <br>It was 11:04 when Patrick walked through the door that final night almost a dozen years ago.<br> <br>I remember the numbers glowing red and angry on the digital clock by our bed, the sound of his key turning in the lock. I remember his sheepish expression, the way his five o&#x2019;clock shadow had bloomed into an almost-beard, the way his shirt looked rumpled as he stood in the doorway. I remember the way he said my name, Kate, like it was an apology and a greeting all in one.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d been listening to Sister Hazel&#x2019;s Fortress, my favorite album at the time, as I waited for him to come home. &#x201c;Champagne High,&#x201d; the fourth track on the CD, was playing, and just before he walked in, I was mouthing the lyrics, thinking to myself how &#x201c;the million hours that we were&#x201d; was such a poetic way to describe a life together.<br> <br>Patrick and I were just four months into our marriage, and I couldn&#x2019;t imagine a day when we&#x2019;d no longer be with each other. I was twenty-eight then, Patrick twenty-nine, and the years seemed to stretch before us into an endless horizon. I remember reflecting that a million hours&#x2014;just over a hundred years&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t sound like enough time.<br> <br>But as it turned out, our hours together were almost up. The number that defined us in the end was only fifteen thousand and nine.<br> <br>That was the number of hours that had passed since we&#x2019;d met at a New Year&#x2019;s Eve party on the last night of 2000, the number of hours we&#x2019;d spent knowing we&#x2019;d found our soul mates, the number of hours we&#x2019;d spent thinking we had it all. But fifteen thousand and nine isn&#x2019;t even close to a million.<br> <br>&#x201c;Honey, I am so, so sorry.&#x201d; Patrick was all apologies as he fumbled his way into the bedroom, where I sat on top of our comforter, knees pulled up to my chest, checking my watch pointedly. The relief that he was home safely was being quickly supplanted by annoyance for making me worry.<br> <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t call.&#x201d; I knew I sounded petulant, but I didn&#x2019;t care. We had made each other a promise the year before, after my uncle had been killed in a hunting accident, that we&#x2019;d always make an effort to let each other know when we were going to be late. My aunt had been blissfully unaware of her husband&#x2019;s death for nearly twenty hours, which had horrified Patrick and me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just got caught up in something,&#x201d; Patrick said, averting his gaze. His thick black hair was mussed and his green eyes were full of concern when he finally looked back at me.<br> <br>I glanced at the phone on our bedside table, the phone that had been silent all night. &#x201c;You were stuck at the office?&#x201d; I asked. It wouldn&#x2019;t have been the first time. Patrick was a risk management consultant for a firm in Midtown. He was young, hungry, one of those people who would always pitch in if there was extra work to be done. I loved that about him.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, Katielee,&#x201d; he said, using the affectionate nickname he&#x2019;d been calling me since the night we met, when he&#x2019;d mistaken my maiden name, Kate Beale, as I shouted it above the din of the crowd. &#x201c;My beautiful Katielee,&#x201d; he murmured as he crossed the room and sat down beside me on the bed. The back of his right hand grazed my left thigh, and I slowly unfolded my legs, melting into him. He inched toward me and wrapped his arm around my shoulders. He smelled like cologne and smoke. &#x201c;I was with Candice,&#x201d; he said into my hair. &#x201c;She had something important she needed to tell me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I pulled away from him and scrambled out of bed. &#x201c;Candice? You were with Candice? Until eleven?&#x201d;<br> <br>Candice Belazar was the girl he&#x2019;d dated just before me, a bartender at a smoky dive in Midtown. It had been a short-term fling and they&#x2019;d broken up two months before we met, but she&#x2019;d been a thorn in my side as long as I&#x2019;d known him. &#x201c;It was just a physical thing,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d tried to explain the first time he told me about her. &#x201c;I was in a rut, and she was there. I got out of it as soon as I realized how wrong we were for each other.&#x201d; But that hadn&#x2019;t been much comfort.<br> <br>We&#x2019;d run into Candice once at a restaurant in Little Italy, and having a face to put with the name only made things worse. She was several inches taller than me, with huge, obviously fake breasts, stringy bleached blond hair, and hollow eyes. She had smirked as she looked me up and down, and I&#x2019;d heard her stage-whisper to her friend that Patrick apparently couldn&#x2019;t handle a real woman anymore.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kate, honey, nothing happened,&#x201d; Patrick said quickly, reaching for me. &#x201c;I would never do anything to hurt you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then why didn&#x2019;t you call?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry.&#x201d; He raked his fingers through his hair. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no excuse. But I would never, ever cheat on you. Ever. You know that.&#x201d; His voice caught at the end of his sentence, but his eyes were as guileless as ever. I felt my shoulders relax a little as some of my indignation rolled away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever,&#x201d; I huffed, because I couldn&#x2019;t think of a better response. I knew he was telling the truth, but the thought of waiting at home while he sat in a bar with his ex-girlfriend still stung. I wasn&#x2019;t going to tell him it was okay, because it wasn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m totally wrong here,&#x201d; he said, spreading his palms in a mea culpa. &#x201c;But it was a heavy conversation, and I didn&#x2019;t feel like I could walk away to make a phone call.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, heaven forbid you offend Candice,&#x201d; I muttered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kate&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Patrick&#x2019;s voice trailed off.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to bed.&#x201d; I knew I was supposed to soften, to tell him it was all right. But I couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you want to talk about this?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>Patrick sighed. &#x201c;Kate, I&#x2019;ll explain everything tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>I rolled my eyes, stormed into the bathroom, and slammed the door behind me. I blinked at my reflection in the mirror, wondering how, nearly two years after they&#x2019;d broken up, Candice still managed to hold some kind of power over my husband.<br> <br>But as I climbed into bed ten minutes later, I could feel myself thawing a little. After all, Patrick had told me right away where he&#x2019;d been. I knew he was being honest. And besides, he&#x2019;d chosen me, and deep down, I knew that he would choose me every day for the rest of our lives. As I pulled the sheets over me, my anger receded in slow, steady waves.<br> <br>I was already half asleep when Patrick came to bed. I turned away from him, facing the wall, and after a moment, I felt his arms encircle me. He moved closer, pressing into my back, entwining his legs with mine.<br> <br>I thought for a moment about pulling away, but it was Patrick, my Patrick. He would tell me in the morning what had happened, and I would understand. So after a pause, I relaxed into his warmth.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know I&#x2019;d never hurt you, Katielee,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;Ever. In a million years. Nothing happened.&#x201d;<br> <br>I closed my eyes and breathed in. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br> <br>Patrick kissed the hollow beneath my left ear, sending a shiver up my spine. &#x201c;I knew before I met you&#x2014;&#x201d; he murmured, just as I began to drift off to sleep.<br> <br>I smiled. &#x201c;&#x2014;that I was meant to be yours,&#x201d; I replied. It was the way we always said I love you, our own special language.<br> <br>I knew I&#x2019;d feel that way for the rest of our lives.<br> <br>Sunlight streamed into the bedroom along with the scents of coffee and bacon when I awoke the next morning. I blinked and rolled over to look at the clock. It was 6:47, and Patrick was already up, making me breakfast. I knew it was his version of an apology, but in truth, he was already forgiven.<br> <br>&#x201c;Morning,&#x201d; I said, covering a yawn as I walked into the kitchen a few minutes later. Patrick turned around holding a spatula, and I began to laugh. He was wearing a yellow KISS THE CHEF apron over his I LOVE NY boxers and white T-shirt. His feet were bare, his hair sleep tousled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Le chef eez at your service,&#x201d; he said in an exaggerated French accent, which made me laugh again. &#x201c;Sit, sit,&#x201d; he said, gesturing toward our tiny kitchen table with his spatula. &#x201c;Breakfast is served, madame.&#x201d;<br> <br>He set two plates of scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, and toast with strawberry jam on the table with a flourish. A moment later, he returned with two steaming cups of coffee, already lightened with cream and sugar, and sat down beside me.<br> <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t have to cook, honey,&#x201d; I said with a smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mais oui.&#x201d; He kissed me on the cheek. &#x201c;Nothing but the best for my girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>I took a bite of my eggs and looked up to see him watching me, his gaze intense. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; I asked, my mouth still full.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no excuse for me not calling last night,&#x201d; he said, his words tumbling out. &#x201c;I feel terrible. I didn&#x2019;t mean to make you worry.&#x201d;<br> <br>I take a sip of my coffee, then I draw a deep breath. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Relief spread across his features like a sunrise. &#x201c;You forgive me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know I overreacted.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, you didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he said quickly. He took a bite of his bacon, and I watch his strong jaw work as he chewed. &#x201c;Look, there&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;d really like to talk to you about,&#x201d; he said. He blinked a few times, and his expression made me suddenly uneasy. He seemed almost nervous. &#x201c;Can I take you to dinner tonight? The restaurant at the Sherry-Netherland, maybe? I know you love that place.&#x201d;<br> <br>I smiled. &#x201c;Sounds great.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you forgetting something?&#x201d; Patrick asked a moment later, as I crunched on a piece of bacon.<br> <br>I looked up. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>He pulled his apron taut and turned to face me. &#x201c;It says Kiss the Chef.&#x201d; He smiled at me, and when I met his eye, he winked. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s only polite to follow apron instructions.&#x201d;<br> <br>I laughed. &#x201c;Is that right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s one of the laws of kitchenocracies around the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Kitchenocracies?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course. Sovereign kitchen nations. Like this one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; I said quite solemnly. &#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t want to violate any laws, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably in your best interest to just follow along, then.&#x201d; He smiled at me, stood, and held out his arms.<br> <br>I laughed and got up. He bent his head, I stood on tiptoe, and our lips met.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good enough?&#x201d; I whispered after a moment as he wrapped his arms around me, folding me in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not even close,&#x201d; he murmured back. Then he was kissing me again, parting my lips gently with his tongue.<br> <br>We made love that morning, quickly, urgently, drinking each other in. Then I cleaned up our breakfast dishes while he showered and dressed for work.<br> <br>&#x201c;Looking good!&#x201d; I marveled with a whistle as he reemerged into the kitchen with freshly washed hair, charcoal pants, a crisp blue shirt, and a striped gray tie.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think the apron and boxers would cut it at the big meeting I have this morning,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;although&#x2014;and I don&#x2019;t want to brag here&#x2014;I do have some seriously sexy legs.&#x201d;<br> <br>I laughed and stood on tiptoe to kiss him good-bye. &#x201c;Good luck with the clients.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who needs luck?&#x201d; he asked with a crooked, dimpled smile. &#x201c;I have the greatest wife in the world. Life is good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Life is good,&#x201d; I agreed. I kissed him again, and this time, it was Patrick who pulled away too soon.<br> <br>When I opened my eyes, he was holding up a silver dollar from his grandfather&#x2019;s old collection. &#x201c;Listen, would you hang on to this for me until tonight?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>I took it with a nod. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this one for?&#x201d; Patrick had a tradition of tossing a silver dollar somewhere nearby whenever something good happened to him. You have to pass the good luck on, he always used to say. That way, someone else gets to make a wish. We&#x2019;d thrown a silver dollar into Central Park the day I&#x2019;d gotten into graduate school, another into the fountain outside City Hall when Patrick got a big promotion last year, and a third into the ocean near his parents&#x2019; house on Long Island after we got married in the spring. &#x201c;Must be something big,&#x201d; I added.<br> <br>&#x201c;It is,&#x201d; he promised. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see. I&#x2019;ll tell you at dinner. We can throw it into the Pulitzer Fountain after we eat. And Katielee?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d;<br> <br>He stood in the doorway and stared at me for a long moment. &#x201c;I knew before I met you&#x2014;&#x201d; he finally said, his voice soft.<br> <br>My heart fluttered. &#x201c;&#x2014;that I was meant to be yours.&#x201d;<br> <br>The door closed behind him at 7:48 a.m.<br> <br>I never saw him again.<br> <br>I was out for my morning run when it happened. While I was jogging north along the Hudson River greenway, marveling at how bright and clear the sky looked after a few days of rain, a thirty-seven-year-old woman named Gennifer Barwin, a tourist from Alabama, was finishing off the bottle of vodka she&#x2019;d started drinking at three in the morning after a fight with her boyfriend. While I was mentally replaying a lecture I&#x2019;d heard the day before in the music therapy graduate program I&#x2019;m just started at NYU, she was strapping her seventeen-month-old daughter Lianna into a car seat in her 1997 Toyota Corolla. While I was thinking how lucky I was that Patrick had encouraged me to quit my banking job to pursue the career I&#x2019;d always wanted, she was pulling out of the parking lot of Hoboken&#x2019;s Starlite Motel.<br> <br>You have to do what your heart tells you to do. Patrick&#x2019;s words of encouragement rang in my ears as my feet pounded the pavement. Life&#x2019;s too short not to follow your dreams, Kate. As I looked up at the sky that morning, reflecting on how wonderfully supportive my husband was, Gennifer Barwin was swerving through the Lincoln Tunnel, headed for Manhattan. As I turned south to head home, she was taking the exit for West Fortieth Street, sideswiping a sign after she got off the highway.<br> <br>And as I smiled to myself, wondering what piece of good luck had made Patrick hand me a silver dollar that morning, Gennifer Barwin was driving at 47 mph directly into the back passenger-side door of the taxi my husband was riding in.<br> <br>Thirty minutes later, I rounded the corner to our fifth-floor apartment, still breathing hard from my run, and found two uniformed police officers standing outside my front door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mrs. Waithman?&#x201d; asked the younger one. I&#x2019;m not sure whether it was his eyes full of sympathy, his somber expression, or the way he said my name, but in an instant, I knew something was terribly wrong.<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; I asked, my knees buckling beneath me. The young officer caught me before I could hit the ground.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, we&#x2019;re very sorry, but your husband was involved in a serious car accident this morning,&#x201d; he said, his voice flat. &#x201c;He was in a cab, ma&#x2019;am. Near Times Square.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, that can&#x2019;t be right,&#x201d; I protested, looking back and forth between the officers. Their faces were suddenly blurry. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s at work. He takes the subway to work.&#x201d; But he had that meeting, I realized immediately, the one with some of his most important clients. He would have taken a taxi from his office to theirs. &#x201c;Oh God.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am&#x2014;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure it&#x2019;s him?&#x201d; I choked out.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am, I&#x2019;m afraid so.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But he&#x2019;s okay, right?&#x201d; I asked into the strangely heavy silence. &#x201c;Of course he&#x2019;s okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mrs. Waithman&#x2014;&#x201d; the younger one began uncertainly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where is he?&#x201d; I cut him off, glancing at the older officer, who reminded me of my dad, someone who would surely make everything okay. &#x201c;Which hospital? Can you take me? I have to help him.&#x201d;<br> <br>From the thin slice of stillness that lingered between them, the way neither of them made a move, I knew before they said the words.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; The older one finally spoke, his eyes watery. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid your husband was pronounced dead at the scene.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. Absolutely not.&#x201d; My reply was instant, for the very concept was impossible. No more than two hours earlier, Patrick and I had made love.

The cortex in the back of our brains scans the environment looking for fertile mates.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;Louann Brizendine, M.D., author, The Female Brain<br><br>If you believe the attractiveness of a slender body and especially a flat abdomen are a recent Western, industrialized-countries phenomenon, history will prove you wrong. In cultures around the world and across the millennia, a slender middle as the hallmark of health, vigor, and beauty has nearly always headed the list of desirable physical attributes in a mate.<br><br>Take, for example, Queen Hatshepsut, fifth pharaoh of the eighteenth dynasty of Egypt and the most powerful woman in her world. She died at age 50 from a ruptured tooth abscess, an ignominious end to be sure. That notwithstanding, as she was borne to her grave a hoary, desiccated corpse, swaddled in folds of her own fat, her funeral procession passed myriad statuary and glyphs representing her, not as she was but as she wished to be: young, sleek, and of slender silhouette. Modern analysis of her mummified remains, however, tells us such was not the case. Middle age had caught up to the queen. It appears that along with being quite obese, she had wretched teeth, bones riddled with tumors, and may have suffered from diabetes as well. Yet during her lifetime and for all the many centuries since her death, her svelte form in statues and paintings belied the middle-aged sprawl of the real Hatshepsut.<br><br>In 1991, feminist Naomi Wolf opined, &#x201c;Beauty is a currency system like the gold standard. Like any economy, it is determined by politics, and in the modern age in the West it is the last, best belief system that keeps male dominance intact.&#x201d; In other words, Ms. Wolf views our opinion of beauty as being based not on any innate or inborn sense of what is attractive, but as a product of our cultural indoctrination. We think a pretty face is pretty or a flat belly is attractive for no other reason than that&#x2019;s the way we&#x2019;ve been programmed to think by the society in which we live. The covers of Playboy, Playgirl, Vogue, and Cosmopolitan, she claims, set our standards for attractiveness, not the reverse. According to Wolf and others of her opinion, there is no universal standard for human beauty. Were we not programmed by advertisers and the entertainment industry, we would find a fat man or woman just as attractive and desirable as a thin one.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>Years of serious scientific study, across numerous disciplines, prove otherwise. Our attraction to a pretty face and a flat belly is in our genes and is an atavistic throwback to a time when such features represented health and the ability to reproduce&#x2014;important requirements in the selection of a mate. As Harvard Professor Deirdre Barrett puts it, these deep-seated universal standards of beauty &#x201c;reflect our evolutionary need to estimate the health of others from their physical characteristics.&#x201d;<br><br>It&#x2019;s not our cultural programming that sets our standards for beauty; it is our instinct.<br><br>As recently as seventy-five years ago there were no reliable antibiotics available to fight bacterial infections and absolutely nothing to deal with myriad other infectious agents to which we humans fall prey. Many diseases common to our great-grandparents&#x2019; generation and before are virtually never seen now. And many of these diseases left disfiguring marks on their victims. For instance, it was common in those days to see people with terrible scarring from smallpox, along with ringworms and running sores from other skin infections. The peaches-and-cream complexions of persons of the opposite sex advertised their health. Who wouldn&#x2019;t be more attracted to someone with smooth, unblemished skin? Rickets and other diseases struck their marks on the bones, leaving their victims with obvious physical deformities. Who in choosing a mate wouldn&#x2019;t be more attracted to someone with a symmetrical physique and straight posture? And women who were youthful and flat of belly were more fertile and therefore more attractive as mates. This all sounds cruel, but unfortunately biology is cruel. Our ideas of beauty are not driven by Madison Avenue, but by the microchip in our DNA, placed there by Mother Nature using her most indispensable tool: natural selection.<br><br>But is Mother Nature&#x2019;s handiwork accurate? Does it apply today? Or is it an artifact of evolution like the vestigial tails on some apes? We would argue that it is accurate. At least the part that makes us perceive a thin waist as more desirable than a thick one.<br><br>Our hard-wiring compels us to be drawn to potential mates with slender midsections because we are drawn to health. Although we may not perceive it at a conscious level, at the DNA level we want to mix our genes with those of someone who is healthy. That innate desire translates to our brains&#x2019; singling out those with narrow waists and deeming them attractive. And with good reason. As it turns out, those flat abdomens usually reside on healthy people.<br><br>For over a century scientists have known that the forces of natural selection have molded our bones, muscles, organs, biochemistry, and physiology to provide optimal health under our evolutionary circumstances. Those who didn&#x2019;t adapt died off. Those who made the cut are the ancestors of we who are alive today. About forty years ago researchers started applying the laws of natural selection, not just to physical adaptations, but to mental adaptations as well. Evolutionary psychologists realized that animals born with instinctive fears&#x2014;for example, fear of falling or fear of snakes or fear of the dark&#x2014;had a greater likelihood of surviving and passing on those inbred fears to their progeny. In the same way, desires were genetically hardwired. Those who developed the instinct to search for mates using looks and/or body size and shape as indicators of good reproductive health were more likely to populate the world with their offspring who carried these same genes.<br><br>Dr. Donald Symons, one of the founders of evolutionary psychology, opines that &#x201c;the tendencies to find healthy people and young women attractive are relatively &#x2018;innate&#x2019; because they are universally associated with reproductive value.&#x201d; And he notes &#x201c;males should be attracted most strongly by females of 23&#x2013;28 years, since they are most likely to produce a viable infant.&#x201d; It so happens that healthy women between the ages of 23 and 28 years old have flat abdomens and waist-to-hip ratios (WHR, or the waist circumference divided by the hip circumference) of about 0.7. A survey looking back at all the Miss Americas for the past nine decades shows their waist-to-hip ratios have been pretty much the same from the 1920s to the 2000s, averaging about 0.7. Although these young women have varied in weight and height over the years, the WHR has remained constant.<br><br>But it&#x2019;s not just young American pageant contestants who are idealized as the paragons of youthful good looks and health. Across the world and across multiple cultures, the small waist and the low WHR are associated with beauty. (In fact, the WHRs of Playboy centerfolds and Miss Hong Kong have each tracked precisely in that range since 1987.) A number of researchers throughout the world have investigated numerous societies, contemporary and ancient, and found that a small WHR is desirable to members of the opposite sex across both time and culture. According to one of the leading investigators in the field &#x201c;waist size is the only scientifically documented visible body part that conveys reliable information about reproductive age, sex hormone profile and risk for major diseases.&#x201d;<br><br>Some physical characteristics or manifestations of disease are pretty obvious. Take the sixteenth-century reformer and author Ulrich von Hutten&#x2019;s description of the signs and symptoms of syphilis, a disease called the &#x201c;Great Pox&#x201d; and common to his age: &#x201c;Boils that stood out like Acorns, from whence issued such filthy stinking Matter, that whosoever came within the Scent, believed himself infected. The Colour of these was of a dark Green and the very Aspect as shocking as the pain itself, which yet was as if the Sick had Laid upon a fire.&#x201d; This gruesome picture was nature&#x2019;s not so subtle way of alerting the dating population that one so afflicted probably wasn&#x2019;t the best mate material. Other signs are not so obvious. At least not on a conscious level.<br><br>The WHR is a subtle sign consciously, maybe, but a strong sign at the subconscious or innate level. Why? Probably because there is a link forged by eons of natural selection between our subconscious sense of another&#x2019;s health and that person&#x2019;s WHR. The correlation between WHR and reproductive health and overall healthiness is so precise that even tiny variations in this measurement herald significant changes in multiple components of fitness.<br><br>For example, multiple autopsy studies on young women who died from nonnatural causes show a significant increase in latent disease when WHR increases above 0.8. The victims were unaware they were so afflicted because the disease processes weren&#x2019;t far enough along to cause symptoms, but they were present in the early stages. To show just how subtle this change is, a slender young woman with a 22.5-inch waist and a 32-inch hip circumference and a 0.7 WHR would have to increase her waist circumference to only 25 inches, a mere 2.5 inch increase (which represents in increase of only 3?4 inch from front to back) to increase her WHR to 0.8 and increase her chances of disease.<br><br>Sex hormones drive the distribution of fat to and from various anatomical areas. Prior to puberty women have WHRs that are about the same as young males, and as they reach menopause, they once again approach the male WHR range (around 0.9). During their fertile years estrogen inhibits the deposition of fat in the abdominal area and shifts it to the hips and thighs, thus the lower WHR. And, what&#x2019;s more, a normal WHR is associated directly with increased fertility. Studies have shown that women with WHRs above 0.8&#x2014;independent of body weight&#x2014;have significantly reduced pregnancy rates than do women with WHRs in the 0.7&#x2013;0.79 range.<br><br>But a lower WHR is not just a sign of fertility. As mentioned above, it is a sign of good physical health all around. And it may even be an indicator of mental health as well. Some studies have shown that higher WHRs correlate with increased vulnerability to stress and a higher prevalence anxiety and depression than normal WHRs.<br><br>Many parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis, amoebiasis, and others cause a swelling of the abdomen without an overall weight gain. These diseases and many others are still prevalent in undeveloped countries, and would have been a common part of our evolutionary heritage. The increase in WHR occasioned by an infection or infestation with one or more of these parasites would be an indication of less than stellar health and would undoubtedly have raised a subtle cause for concern in potential mates.<br><br>In view of our modern medical evidence it seems pretty obvious that an increase in WHR&#x2014;even a slight one&#x2014;should give us insight into the overall health status of another, but that&#x2019;s today. What about in ancient times? How could early man (or woman) recognize these subtle changes as portraying a less than perfect mate, at least from a health perspective? No one knows with certainty how people in centuries past could suss out slight variations in WHR, but the evidence is pretty clear that they did. And the same goes for most non-Westernized societies today.<br><br>Dr. Devendra Singh from the University of Texas studied the WHR of members of a couple of isolated herder-gatherer tribes in southern India and found them to be in the same average range as Caucasian men and women. A number of members of one of these tribes had moved to the city to work as laborers and had been exposed to Western media. Dr. Singh queried subjects who were city dwellers and those who stayed in their remote environment about the body types each felt to be the most attractive. He did so by showing adult males from both groups photos of female nudes of varying sizes and shapes. These photos were a set that had been used by other researchers in published work evaluating the body size and shape preferences of Western males. Since Dr. Singh&#x2019;s Indian subjects were illiterate, he had them look at the photos and draw a line on a sheet of paper to express their opinions of the attractiveness of the women portrayed in the set of photographs&#x2014;a long line for very attractive and a short line for less attractive. As Dr. Singh points out in his published research, &#x201c;the results showed that the attractiveness rating was jointly determined by body mass index&#x2014;BMI&#x2014;and WHR. Photographs were judged to be attractive only if they were normal BMI and a low WHR.&#x201d; There was no difference in the judgment of what constituted attractiveness between the tribal group that had moved to the city and the tribal group that had not. Moreover, their judgments were practically identical to those of U.S. participants.<br><br>According to Dr. Singh, this is the only attractiveness study to his knowledge conducted among a tribal population using photographs of women with known BMI and WHR. Despite finding identical results between city dwellers and country dwellers from the same tribe, questions still linger as to whether or not the concept of what constitutes beauty is innate or somehow a product of modern culture. Despite their being illiterate, who knows if the tribesmen still living as hunter- gatherers have had the opportunity to be influenced by the long arm of modern media? In an effort to totally eliminate the possibility of contamination by exposure to today&#x2019;s ubiquitous newspapers, magazines, and TV, Dr. Singh decided to look at ancient cultures. He measured WHRs in almost 300 Greco-Roman, Indian, Egyptian, and African sculptures, and he found that across all these cultures WHR distributions varied, but the average clustered around 0.7 for women and 0.9 for men, which is the same as is regarded as ideal today.<br><br>Yet another research group took on the prodigious task of deciphering WHRs by analyzing over 300 photographs of artwork from Europe, Africa, America, and Asia dating from the Upper Paleolithic period until 1999. As with the Singh study of statuary, this international group of experts found that the depictions of female WHR clustered in the range of 0.6 to 0.7 and have remained remarkably unchanged from 32,000 years ago until the present.<br><br>Another nascent science, or social science at least, confirms the findings of the evolutionary psychologists that a low WHR is rooted deep in our innate development as humans. Literary Darwinists apply evolution-based research to works of fiction. Since the advent of written literature (much of which, like Homer&#x2019;s Iliad and Odyssey, are the written version of oral literature that is centuries older), a number of themes on love, life, loss, and attraction persist with little variation across all cultures and time spans. Owing to these thematic similarities, literary Darwinists posit that these represent the inborn desires and feelings of the majority of humanity.<br><br>One such literary Darwinist, Jonathan Gottschall, from Washington and Jefferson College, writes in the New Scientist that folk tales from around the world contain references to females as being attractive two to six times more often as compared to their male counterparts. And a small WHR, representing youth and fertility, is a primary component of their attractiveness. Though it&#x2019;s likely impossible to computer-search the world&#x2019;s literature to determine a specific WHR from literature hundreds of years old, it is possible to look for mentions of slender or small waists.

The breadth of the collection makes these 37 stories an extremely complete map of Carver territory, of a particular area of America and of the specific texture of the people Carver writes about -- their difficult attempts at survival in a world where happiness does not arrive wrapped up in neat packages but comes in far more peculiar parcels, if it comes at all.By the time of his early death in 1988, Raymond Carver had established himself as one of the great practitioners of the American short story, a writer who had not only found his own voice but imprinted it in the imagination of thousands of readers. <p>The Philadelphia Inquirer calls Raymond Carver "one of the great short story writers of our time-of any time" and The New York Times Book Review says his stories "can already be counted among the masterpieces of American fiction." Where I'm Calling From contains thirty-seven of his best works and reflects Carver's development as a writer over a period of more than two decades. </p><p>In his introduction to this selection, Carver noted V. S. Pritchett's definition of a short story as "something glimpsed from the corner of the eye, in passing." Carver elaborated: "First the glimpse. The glimpse given life, turned into something that will illuminate the moment and just maybe lock it indelibly into the reader's consciousness. Make it a part of the reader's own experience, as Hemingway so nicely put it. Forever, the writer hopes. Forever." This essential work shows beyond all doubt that Carver's hope has been triumphantly fulfilled. </p><p>"Considered as an extended work, the book summarizes Carver's writing career and testifies to a literary achievement equaled only by the very best of modern American story writers-Hemingway, Welty, Salinger, Cheever. . . .

He studied English, Persian, Arabic and Islamic studies at the universities of Dublin, Edinburgh and Cambridge, and Morocco and Newcastle upon Tyne. He lives in the north of England with his wife.British author Aycliffe (Naomi's Room) generates some genuine fear in the early chapters of this briskly paced if meandering horror novel, but he reveals too much too soon, rendering the rest of the story anticlimactic where tension should be mounting. After a prologue in which medieval Muslims hide a satanic idol in a soon-to-be-buried Babylonian sanctuary, the action shifts to modern-day London, where Tom Alton, a Mesopotamian scholar, has just taken a job as a British Museum curator. An archeologist friend, Ed Monelli, arrives in town to donate to the museum an extraordinary and eerie statue of Satan, discovered by Ed's archeologist wife shortly before her mysterious death. Tom accepts the gift, though the statue, kept briefly at the Alton home, has troubling effects on his wife, Nicola, and his young stepson, Adam. In dramatically muddled ways, the author introduces elements reminiscent of The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby Adam suffers an unaccountable fall that leaves him mentally and physically precocious and possessed by the devil, while Nicola becomes pregnant with a fetus that grows at supernatural speed. The protagonists, Tom and Nicola, are unconvincing in part because they lack a sense of proportion, as when Nicola, amid all the horrors, objects, "Adam can't afford to miss school." A padded plot that fails to cohere, as well as often trite or hackneyed prose ("The snow continued falling, unaware of grief or happiness"), makes for a book likely to please only Aycliffe loyalists. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Les Amies De Place Blanche</h2><p><p>Originally published in 1983, <i>Les Amies</i> focuses on the transsexual community around the Place Blanche district of Paris in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Both McGeorge Bundy, a national security advisor, and William Bundy, a senior official at the Pentagon and State Department, were liberal anti-Communists trying to balance American interests in Southeast Asia between what they considered the dangerous extremes of both Left and Right. They came under enormous criticism for their roles, but author Kai Bird argues that newly declassified documents "show that the Bundys and other decision-makers registered deep doubts about the American enterprise in Vietnam and did so far earlier than most historians had thought." This hardly exonerates them, in Bird's view: "They knew how badly the war was going as early as 1964-65, yet they found a way to persist in folly." Their tale didn't end in the 1960s. McGeorge Bundy, for instance, went on to head the Ford Foundation for 13 years, where he played an enormously important role in shaping modern liberalism. Bird, a Guggenheim Fellow and contributing editor to <i>The Nation</i>, tells the Bundys' story with great clarity and sound judgment; <i>The Color of Truth</i> is a surprisingly absorbing book. <i>--John Miller</i>Kai Bird is the author of <i>The Chairman: John J.

Sometimes he saw a crucifix on the wall or a pole beside his bed, and at other times there were two of them, side by side or one on top of the other. He had no idea where he was. But that was nothing new. Philippe hadn&#x2019;t known for weeks. He no longer recognized his mother or his sister. Sometimes he didn&#x2019;t even respond to his own name when the nurses spoke to him.<br>&#x201c;The water it wills the way . . . ,&#x201d; Philippe began to say, but his words sputtered into a garble of nonsensical French.<br>He was vaguely cognizant of his own incoherence. He was also aware of the shadowy figure of a woman standing by his bed. Or was it two women?<br>&#x201c;Georges knows, and Sylvie, too,&#x201d; he said to her. &#x201c;The water! It wills . . .&#x201d;<br>A smell drifted to Philippe, and he stopped trying to speak. Something pleasant, even comforting. His eyes swung back and forth over his own hand until he felt dizzy. A plume of smoke drifted above his fingers. A wisp of a memory. Then it was gone.<br>A soft but cold hand gripped his fingers. The woman was nearer now. There was something familiar about her, but her presence conjured a contradictory sense of vulnerability and security. She spoke to him, but somewhere between his ears and his brain the words were lost. The woman was smiling. Or was she laughing at him? Philippe could not tell.<br>Then he noticed the lit cigarette, or possibly two, between his trembling fingers. And that sight relaxed him as much as its welcome aroma. He wanted to bring it to his lips, but his hand wouldn&#x2019;t cooperate. Exhausted and nauseated from the double vision, he closed his eyes and let his head fall back on the pillow.<br>He began to drift off, but he was awakened by his own involuntary cough.<br>The odor was far more intense now. Foreign. An incomprehensible sense of danger welled inside him. His hand felt hot.<br>Philippe tried to focus on his fingers. The woman was nowhere to be seen&#x2014;he had already forgotten her, anyway&#x2014;but a flame flickered between his fingers. The pain engorged his hand. He jerked his arm away, but the searing discomfort had already spread to his back, buttocks, and thighs.<br>The smoke was thicker, breathing harder. Philippe gagged on the acrid smell of burning flesh, not comprehending that it was his own skin on fire. But enough of his brain function endured to experience the agony. He searched frantically for the right words. Instead of a cry for help, other words tumbled from his lips: &#x201c;The water wills . . .&#x201d; His cough choked off the rest of it.<br>He looked down and saw four legs engulfed in flames. The pain was immeasurable.

Schwartz was a professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta and the president of Creative Educational Services, Inc., a consulting firm specializing in leadership development. He died in 1987.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>Believe You Can Succeed and You Will</b> </p><p> Success means many wonderful, positive things. Success means personal prosperity: a fine home, vacations, travel, new things, financial security, giving your children maximum advantages. Success means winning admiration, leadership, being looked up to by people in your business and social life. Success means freedom: freedom from worries, fears, frustrations, and failure. Success means self-respect, continually finding more real happiness and satisfaction from life, being able to do more for those who depend on you. </p><p> Success means winning. </p><p> Success -- achievement -- is the goal of life! </p><p> Every human being wants success. Everybody wants the best this life can deliver. Nobody enjoys crawling, living in mediocrity. No one likes feeling second-class and feeling forced to go that way. </p><p> Some of the most practical success-building wisdom is found in that Biblical quotation stating that faith can move mountains. </p><p> Believe, really believe, you can move a mountain and you can. Not many people believe that they can move mountains. So, as a result, not many people do. </p><p> On some occasion you've probably heard someone say something like, "It's nonsense to think you can make a mountain move away just by saying 'Mountain, move away.' It's simply impossible." </p><p> People who think this way have belief confused with wishful thinking. And true enough, you can't <i>wish</i> away a mountain. You can't <i>wish</i> yourself into an executive suite. Nor can you wish yourself into a five-bedroom, three-bath house or the high-income brackets. You can't wish yourself into a position of leadership. </p><p> But you <i>can</i> move a mountain with belief. You <i>can</i> win success by believing you can succeed. </p><p> There is nothing magical nor mystical about the power of belief. </p><p> Belief works this way. Belief, the "I'm-positive-I-can" attitude, generates the power, skill, and energy needed to do. When you believe I-can-do-it, the <i>how</i>-to-do-it develops. </p><p> Every day all over the nation young people start working in new jobs. Each of them "wishes" that someday he could enjoy the success that goes with reaching the top. But the majority of these young people simply don't have the belief that it takes to reach the top rungs. And they don't reach the top. Believing it's impossible to climb high, they do not discover the steps that lead to great heights. Their behavior remains that of the "average" person. </p><p> But a small number of these young people really believe they will succeed. They approach their work with the "I'm-going-to-the-top" attitude. And with substantial belief they reach the top. Believing they will succeed -- and that it's not impossible -- these folks study and observe the behavior of senior executives. They learn how successful people approach problems and make decisions. They observe the attitudes of successful people. </p><p> The how-to-do-it always comes to the person who believes he can do it. </p><p> A young woman I'm acquainted with decided two years ago that she was going to establish a sales agency to sell mobile homes. She was advised by many that she shouldn't -- and couldn't do it. </p><p> She had less than $3,000 in savings, and was advised the minimum capital investment required was many times that. </p><p> "Look how competitive it is," she was advised. "And besides, what practical experience have you had in selling mobile homes, let alone managing a business?" her advisors asked. </p><p> But this young lady had belief in herself and her ability to succeed. She quickly admitted she lacked capital, that the business was very competitive, and that she lacked experience. </p><p> "But," she said, "all the evidence I can gather shows that the mobile home industry is going to expand. On top of that, I've studied my competition. I know I can do a better job of merchandising trailers than anybody else in this town. I expect to make some mistakes, but I'm going to be on top in a hurry." </p><p> And she was. She had little trouble getting capital. Her absolutely unquestioned belief that she could succeed with this business won her the confidence of two investors. And armed with complete belief, she did the "impossible" -- she got a trailer manufacturer to advance her a limited inventory with no money down. </p><p> Last year she sold over $1,000,000 worth of trailers. </p><p> "Next year," she says, "I expect to gross over $2,000,000." </p><p> Belief, <i>strong belief,</i> triggers the mind to figuring ways and means and how-to. And believing you can succeed makes others place confidence in you. </p><p> Most people do not put much stock in belief. But some, the residents of Successfulville, USA, do! Just a few weeks ago a friend who is an official with a state highway department in a Midwestern state related a "mountain-moving" experience to me. </p><p> "Last month," my friend began, "our department sent notices to a number of engineering companies that we were authorized to retain some firm to design eight bridges as part of our highway building program. The bridges were to be built at a cost of $5,000,000. The engineering firm selected would get a 4 per cent commission, or $200,000, for its design work. </p><p> "I talked with 21 engineering firms about this. The four largest decided right away to submit proposals. The other 17 companies were small, having only 3 to 7 engineers each. The size of the project scared off 16 of these 17. They went over the project, shook their heads, and said in effect, 'It's too big for us. I wish I thought we could handle it, but it's no use even trying.' </p><p> "But one of these small firms, a company with only three engineers, studied the plans and said, 'We can do it. We'll submit a proposal.' They did, and they got the job." </p><p> Those who believe they can move mountains, do. Those who believe they can't, cannot. Belief triggers the power to do. </p><p> Actually, in these modem times belief is doing much bigger things than moving mountains. The most essential element -- in fact, <i>the</i> essential element -- in our space explorations today is belief that space can be mastered. Without firm, unwavering belief that man <i>can</i> travel in space, our scientists would not have the courage, interest, and enthusiasm to proceed. Belief that cancer can be cured will ultimately produce cures for cancer. Currently; there is some talk of building a tunnel under the English Channel to connect England with the Continent. Whether this tunnel is ever built depends on whether responsible people believe it can be built. </p><p> Belief in great results is the driving force, the power behind all great books, plays, scientific discoveries. Belief in success is behind every successful business, church, and political organization. Belief in success is the one basic, absolutely essential ingredient in successful people. </p><p> Believe, really believe, you can succeed and you will. </p><p> Over the years I've talked with many people who have failed in business ventures and in various careers. I've heard a lot of reasons and excuses for failure. Something especially significant unfolds as conversations with failures develop. In a casual sort of way the failure drops a remark like "To tell the truth, I didn't think it would work" or "I had my misgivings before I even started out" or "Actually, I wasn't too surprised that it didn't work out." </p><p> The "Okay-I'll-give-it-a-try-but-I-don't-think-it-will-work" attitude produces failures. </p><p> Disbelief is negative power. When the mind disbelieves or doubts, the mind attracts "reasons" to support the disbelief. Doubt, disbelief, the <i>subconscious will to fail,</i> the <i>not really wanting</i> to succeed, is responsible for most failures. </p><p> Think doubt and fail. </p><p> Think victory and succeed. </p><p> A young fiction writer talked with me recently about her writing ambitions. The name of one of the top writers in her field came up. </p><p> "Oh," she said, "Mr. X is a wonderful writer, but of course, I can't be nearly as successful as he is." </p><p> Her attitude disappointed me very much because I know the writer mentioned. He is not super-intelligent nor super-perceptive, nor super-anything else except super-confident. He believes he is among the best and so he acts and performs the best. </p><p> It is well to respect the leader. Learn from him. Observe him. Study him. But don't worship him. Believe you can surpass. Believe you can go beyond. Those who harbor the second-best attitude are invariably second-best doers. </p><p> Look at it this way. Belief is the thermostat that regulates what we accomplish in life. Study the fellow who is shuffling down there in mediocrity. He believes he is worth little, so he receives little. He believes he can't do big things, and he doesn't. He believes he is unimportant, so everything he does has an unimportant mark. As times goes by, lack of belief in himself shows through in the way the fellow talks, walks, acts. Unless he readjusts his thermostat forward, he shrinks, grows smaller and smaller in his own estimation. And, since others see in us what we see in ourselves, he grows smaller in the estimation of the people around him. </p><p> Now look across the way at the person who is advancing forward. He believes he is worth much, and he receives much. He believes he can handle big, difficult assignments -- and he does. Everything he does, the way he handles himself with people, his character, his thoughts, his viewpoints, all say, "Here is a professional. He is an important person." </p><p> A person is a product of his own thoughts. Believe Big. Adjust your thermostat forward. Launch your success offensive with honest, sincere belief that you can succeed. Believe big and grow big. </p><p> Several years ago after addressing a group of business men in Detroit, I talked with one of the gentlemen who approached me, introduced himself, and said, "I really enjoyed your talk. Can you spare a few minutes? I'd like very much to discuss a personal experience with you." </p><p> In a few minutes we were comfortably seated in a coffee shop, waiting for some refreshments. </p><p> "I have a personal experience," he began, "that ties in perfectly with what you said this evening about making your mind work for you instead of letting it work against you. I've never explained to anyone how I lifted myself out of the world of mediocrity; but I'd like to tell you about it." </p><p> "And I'd like to hear it," I said. </p><p> "Well, just five years ago I was plodding along, just another guy working in the tool-and-die trade. I made a decent living by average standards. But it was far from ideal. Our home was much too small and there was no money for those many things we wanted. My wife, bless her, didn't complain much, but it was written all over her that she was more resigned to her fate than she was happy. Inside I grew more and more dissatisfied. When I let myself see how I was failing my good wife and two children, I really hurt inside. </p><p> "But today things are really different," my friend continued. "Today we have a beautiful new home on a two-acre lot and a year-round cabin a couple hundred miles north of here. There's no more worry about whether we can send the kids to a good college and my wife no longer has to feel guilty every time she spends money for some new clothes. Next summer the whole family is flying to Europe to spend a month's holiday. We're really living." </p><p> "How did this all happen?" I asked. </p><p> "It all happened," he continued, "when to use the phrase you used tonight, 'I harnessed the power of belief.' Five years ago I learned about a job with a tool-and-die company here in Detroit. We were living in Cleveland at the time. I decided to look into it, hoping I could make a little more money. I got here early on Sunday evening, but the interview was not until Monday. </p><p> "After dinner I sat down in my hotel room and for some reason, I got really disgusted with myself. 'Why,' I asked myself, 'am I just a middle class failure? Why am I trying to get a job that represents such a small step forward?' </p><p> "I don't know to this day what prompted me to do it, but I took a sheet of hotel stationery and wrote down the names of five people I've known well for several years who had far surpassed me in earning power and job responsibility. Two were former neighbors who had moved away to fine subdivisions. Two others were fellows I had worked for, and the third was a brother-in-law. </p><p> "Next -- again I don't know what made me do this -- I asked myself what do my five friends have that I don't have, besides better jobs. I compared myself with them on intelligence, but I honestly couldn't see that they excelled in the brains department. Nor could I truthfully say they had me beat on education, integrity; or personal habits. </p><p> "Finally I got down to another success quality one hears a lot about. Initiative. Here I hated to admit it, but I had to. On this point my record showed I was far below that of my successful friends. </p><p> "It was now about 3:00 A.M., but my mind was astonishingly clear. I was seeing my weak point for the first time. I discovered that I had held back. I had always carried a little stick. I dug into myself deeper and deeper and found the reason I lacked initiative was because I didn't believe inside that I was worth very much. </p><p> "I sat there the rest of the night just reviewing how lack of faith in myself had dominated me ever since I could remember, how I had used my mind to work against myself. I found I had been preaching to myself why I couldn't get ahead instead of why I could. I had been selling myself short. I found this streak of self-depreciation showed through in everything I did. Then it dawned on me that no one else was going to believe in me until I believed in myself. </p><p> "Right then I decided, 'I'm through feeling second-class. From here on in I'm not going to sell myself short.' </p><p> "Next morning I still had that confidence. During the job interview I gave my new found confidence its first test. Before coming for the interview I'd hoped I would have courage to ask for $750 or maybe even $1000 more than my present job was paying. But now, after realizing I <i>was</i> a valuable man, I upped it to $3,500. And I got it. I sold myself because after that one long night of self-analysis I found things in myself that made me a lot more saleable. </p><p> "Within two years after I took that job I had established a reputation as the fellow who can get business. Then we went into a recession. This made me still more valuable because I was one of the best business-getters in the industry. The company was reorganized and I was given a substantial amount of stock plus a lot more pay." </p><p> Believe in yourself and good things <i>do</i> start happening. </p><p> Your mind is a "thought factory." It's a busy factory; producing countless thoughts in one day. </p><p> Production in your thought factory is under the charge of two foremen, one of whom we will call Mr. Triumph and the other Mr. Defeat. Mr. Triumph is in charge of manufacturing positive thoughts. He specializes in producing reasons why you can, why you're qualified, why you will. </p><p> The other foreman, Mr. Defeat, produces negative, depreciating tho...</p></p><h2>The Tyranny of Story: Audience Expectations and the Short Screenplay</h2><p><i>The Tyranny of Story</i> offers a unique perspective on the art of storytelling, regardless of format.

They woke up to self and found themselves imprisoned by a completely new nature-the sin nature-which would poison the entire human race for all time. From then until now, the troubles of the world-wars, man&#39;s inhumanity to man, his dependency on cruel vices, and the habits of hell-are all caused by the sin nature which rules every person. Of course the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ broke the hold of this deadly yoke and repositioned the believer in Christ. So why do Christians struggle so hard to live for God? In this revelatory book, Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart explains how the sin nature, which remains in Christians, can be reactivated, and how victory over the world, the flesh, and the Devil can only be maintained through faith in the Cross of Christ.</p><p></p><h2>Walter Wick&#39;s Optical Tricks</h2><p>The winner of a 1997 Boston Globe/Horn Book Award for A Drop of Water and contributor to the best-selling I Spy books presents a photographic book of optical illusions sure to stagger and delight young readers.</p><p>From the creator of the I Spy books and the award-winning, irresistibly aquatic <i>A Drop of Water</i> comes <i>Walter Wick's Optical Tricks</i>.

The billiard ball, also a number 4, is reflected backward in the mirror, but the block number 4 is not. Why not? Fortunately, readers can flip to the back of the book, where Wick explains the illusions in his refreshingly straightforward and concise manner. <p> Brilliantly composed photographs of simple props, expert lighting, and myriad mirrors baffle us page after page: a "Tricky Triangle" that has a peculiar twist; a bogus box; Escher-like visual deceptions; and more. Wick explains, "As much as possible, the photographs are designed to challenge readers to compare <i>true perceptions</i> (the objects as they really exist) with <i>false perceptions</i> (the illusions) as a way to cultivate visual logic skills and to sharpen powers of observation." This visually maddening, mind-bending book will challenge and entertain even the keenest young observers. Is it all smoke and mirrors? Most certainly.

Brock Cheney explores the foodways of Mormon pioneers from their trek west through the arrival of the railroad and reveals new perspectives on the fasci-nating Mormon settlement era. Relying on original diaries, newspaper accounts, and recipe books from the 1850s, Cheney draws a vivid portrait of what Mormon pioneers ate and drank. Although other authors have sketched the subject before, this portrait is the first effort that might be described as scholarly, though the lively prose will interest a broad general audience.<br><br>Presented here are the first explicit descriptions of the menus, food processes, and recipes of the Mormon pioneers. While many have supposed that earlier pioneer foodways continued to be handed down through Mormon families, Cheney has confirmed traditions going back generations and covering more than a century. The book also exposes myths and clich�s about pioneer piety and hardships, as Cheney examines such pioneer extravagances as fresh &#x201c;oysters on the half shell&#x201d; and pioneer trends of alcohol consumption.<br><br>A perfect gift for the history buff or Dutch oven chef, <i>Plain But Wholesome</i> will also prove its place among scholars and historians.

By the author of McNally&#39;s Puzzle. Reissue.</p><p><p>Lawrence Sanders (1920&#x2013;1998) was the New York Times bestselling author of more than forty mystery and suspense novels including the Edward X. Delaney, Archy McNally, and Timothy Cone series, as well as the acclaimed Commandment books. The Anderson Tapes received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for best first novel.</p>In a popular series of books, P.I. Archy McNally, witty and raffish, tells how he solves crimes among the rich and famous in tony Palm Beach. In this bestseller, his father, an insurance executive, assigns the debonair detective to work undercover to identify the thief who has pilfered the Forsythe family's priceless first edition of Poe. The bon mots come thick and fast as the plot thickens. While narrator Adam Henderson has an admirably expressive voice, he is a bit too fey to impersonate our hero. In his mouth the quips sound forced, the characters cartoonish. Yet he grows on the listener as the tape spools on, and at last, though he may not be the McNally that Sanders has written, he is a McNally worth listening to.

Nicolson was an MP (Conservative, 1935-45, who also flirted with Labour after WWII). He had previously been in the Foreign Office and attended the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, and material from his period is included in this new edition for the first time. </p><p>Nicolson never achieved high office, but rarely a day went by when he didn't record what was going on at Westminster. He socialised widely, was married to the poet and author Vita Sackville-West, and together they created the famous garden at Sissinghurst. Both were bi-sexuals and had affairs outside their marriage. This new edition also draws on diary entries and letters previously considered too sensitive for inclusion. </p><p>The diversity of Harold Nicolson's interests and the irony in his writing make his diary a highly entertaining record of his life and times, as well as a document of great historical value.</p></p><p>Nigel Nicolson is the co-founder of Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson; he was a Conservative MP in the 1950s, but was sacked by his Bournemouth and Christchurch constituency for attacking Anthony Eden, the PM, over Suez.

In Indian mythology, the Age of Kali is characterized as one of darkness. The 19 essays in the Age o f Kali, which have never been available in the United States, portray the Indian subcontinent (including Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Reunion, an island in the Indian Ocean) in the 1990s. The essays offer a wide range of interesting portraits, from a chief minister who is not upper caste, a village social worker who triumphs over reactionary forces, and a Hindi rap megastar. Dalrymple's account is most readable when he shows without simplification in the disparate elements and challenges faced on many fronts, and it is essential reading for anyone interested in the Indian subcontinent. With the publication of The Age of Kali, Lonely Planet is reissuing In Xanadu (originally published in a 1989 Vintage edition), which won the 1990 Yorkshire Post Best First Work Award and a Scottish Arts Council Spring Book Award. In this travelog, Dalrymple retraced Marco Polo's route from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem to Kubla Khan's summer capital in Xanadu, entering China without a permit. His purpose was to describe the places and people he encountered on the road and interweave them with historical flashbacks to Polo's time. In Xanadu is recommended for public libraries, while The Age of Kali is suitable for both public and academic.<br><i>-Ravi Shenoy, North Central Coll. Lib., Naperville, IL. </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.Following in the footsteps of Marco Polo, then-Cambridge University student Dalrymplepk embarks on an overland journey from Jerusalem to Xanadu, through "twelve thousand miles of extremely dangerous, inhospitable territory." Ultimately, there is scarcely any danger, but there is ample history and color. In the ancient city of Acre, Dalrymple refuses narcotics from an Arab boy who, when praised for his excellent English, reveals that he learned it in jail. When Dalrymple reaches Iran with a female companion in tow, he is surprised by how tolerant and Westernized Iranians are, despite the religious revolution. Upon seeing a sign that says, "Allah Commands the Re-use of Renewable Resources," the author observes, "We had expected anything of the Ayatollah. But hardly that he would turn out to be an enthusiastic ecologist." Dalrymple is a delightful guide, capable of waxing poetic upon first sight of the Euphrates River, while maintaining the bright-eyed perceptions of an explorer. When, like Polo, he arrives in Xanadu with a phial of holy oil, it is the culmination of a brave and fantastic journey. The author is bureau chief for the London Sunday Correspondent in New Delhi.

Through the album, Fetvac&#x131; sheds light on imperial ideals as well as relationships between court life and popular culture, and shows that the boundaries between Ottoman art and the art of Iran and Western Europe were much more porous than has been assumed.

His last poem, Pale Fire, is put into a book, together with a preface, a lengthy commentary and notes by Shade&#39;s editor, Charles Kinbote. Known on campus as the &#39;Great Beaver&#39;, Kinbote is haughty, inquisitive, intolerant, but is he also mad, bad - and even dangerous? As his wildly eccentric annotations slide into the personal and the fantastical, Kinbote reveals perhaps more than he should. Nabokov&#39;s darkly witty, richly inventive masterwork is a suspenseful whodunit, a story of one-upmanship and dubious penmanship, and a glorious literary conundrum.</p><p>Like <i>Lolita</i>, Vladimir Nabokov's <i>Pale Fire</i> is a masterpiece that imprisons us inside the mazelike head of a mad �migr�. Yet <i>Pale Fire</i> is more outrageously hilarious, and its narrative convolutions make the earlier book seem as straightforward as a fairy tale. Here's the plot--listen carefully! John Shade is a homebody poet in New Wye, U.S.A. He writes a 999-line poem about his life, and what may lie beyond death. This novel (and seldom has the word seemed so woefully inadequate) consists of both that poem and an extensive commentary on it by the poet's crazy neighbor, Charles Kinbote.<p> According to this deranged annotator, he had urged Shade to write about his own homeland--the northern kingdom of Zembla. It soon becomes clear that this fabulous locale may well be a figment of Kinbote's colorfully cracked, prismatic imagination. Meanwhile, he manages to twist the poem into an account of Zembla's King Charles--whom he believes himself to <i>be</i>--and the monarch's eventual assassination by the revolutionary Jakob Gradus.</p><p> In the course of this dizzying narrative, shots are indeed fired. But it's Shade who takes the hit, enabling Kinbote to steal the dead poet's manuscript and set about annotating it. Is that perfectly clear? By now it should be obvious that <i>Pale Fire</i> is not only a whodunit but a who-wrote-it. There isn't, of course, a single solution. But Nabokov's best biographer, Brian Boyd, has come up with an ingenious suggestion: he argues that Shade is actually guiding Kinbote's mad hand from beyond the grave, nudging him into completing what he'd intended to be a 1,000-line poem. Read this magical, melancholic mystery and see if you agree. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>In Pale Fire Nabokov offers a cornucopia of deceptive pleasures: a 999-line poem by the reclusive genius John Shade; an adoring foreword and commentary by Shade&#39;s self-styled Boswell, Dr. Charles Kinbote; a darkly comic novel of suspense, literary idolatry and one-upmanship, and political intrigue.</p><h2>The Reality Dysfunction (The Night&#39;s Dawn trilogy)</h2><p>Reality Dysfunction</p><p>Peter F. Hamilton was born in Rutland in 1960 and still lives nearby. He began writing in 1987, and sold his first short story to Fear magazine in 1988. He has written many bestselling novels, including the Greg Mandel series, the Night&#39;s Dawn trilogy, the Commonwealth Saga, the Void trilogy, short story collections and several standalone novels.First published in 1996, this behemoth opening to the Night's Dawn trilogy takes humankind across the galaxy on a quest for profit that becomes a desperate battle for survival. Space scavenger Joshua Calvert begins shipping wood from the primitive planet Lalonde to the pastoral patrician planet Kulu despite a revolt among the prisoners who serve as Lalonde's forced labor. A greater threat lurks within Lalonde's intensely claustrophobic jungle: an energy virus that turns people into zombies and that even 27th-century biotechnology can't cure. Hamilton succinctly uses strong visual imagery to bring each culture and civilization to life. Only this relative economy of language allows so many plots, subplots and characters to be squeezed into over 900 pages. Elements of space opera, Straubesque horror and adrenaline-laced action make this a demanding, rewarding read. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Uniquely filling this gap, CHarles Frazee&#39;s Two Thousand Years Ago offers an absorbing unprecedented survey of peoples and events around the world at the time of Jesus.</p><p>Charles A. Frazee is professor of church history at Episcopal Theological School, Claremont, California.Frazee expertly imagines Jesus' life and destiny had he been born anywhere but Bethlehem. Every chapter of this oversized coffee table book covers a region of the world during the era of Christ, offering an accessible and entertaining update on the religious and spiritual beliefs of each land. Frazee, a professor of church history at Episcopal Theological School in Claremont, California, muses upon how Jesus would have influenced each region had it been his birthplace. For instance, as a miracle worker Christ may have wowed the Egyptians, since their spirituality was heavily influenced by magical thinking. But in Northern Europe, Frazee claims, Jesus' teachings might have flopped. The Celts, Germans, and other Europeans were so focused on survival and resolving conflicts with violence, that "Jesus' teaching of love, non-violence, and peace would have seemed preposterous to them." In China, Jesus' linear concept of time and his focus on entering God's kingdom would have clashed with the secular views of Confucius and Lao-tzu, who "were intent on instructing men and women on how to find harmony in this lifetime, not in any lifetime to come." Frazee's compelling comparisons also include the Arctic, Pacific Islands, and the Americas-almost always concluding that Jesus' teachings would never have taken hold anywhere other than the Middle East. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>OUR HISTORY,VOLUME 2</h2><p>Note: This is a standalone product.</p><p></p><h2>Out of My Life and Thought: An Autobiography</h2><p>An autobiography of the theologian, organist, philospher, scientist, physician, missionary who won the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize</p><p><i>Out of My Life and Thought</i> is the autobiography of Albert Schweitzer, the theologian, musician, scientist, and medical missionary who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952 (and donated his prize to build a leper colony). Schweitzer's autobiography is a masterful and motley blend of confession, narrative, adventure, and philosophy. The chapters about how he came to write <i>The Quest for the Historical Jesus</i> and <i>The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle</i> are indispensable summaries of and apologies for those books; the chapter called "I Resolve to Become a Jungle Doctor" is a model of Rilke-style life-changing decision; and the chapters on Bach and on organs are full of fascinating historical and mechanical detail. For contemporary readers, <i>Out of My Life and Thought</i> may be most compelling for its epilogue, which describes the ethical mysticism that Schweitzer called "Reverence for Life," which he achieved in his later years. The epilogue is full of stirringly Germanic passages such as the following: "Once man begins to think about the mystery of his life and the links connecting him with the life that fills the world, he cannot but accept, for his own life and all other life that surrounds him, the principle of Reverence for Life. He will act according to this principle of the ethical affirmation of life in everything he does. His life will become in every respect more difficult than if he lived for himself, but at the same time it will be richer, more beautiful, and happier. It will become, instead of mere living, a genuine experience of life." Because Schweitzer believed Christianity implied such world-encompassing reverence, he had the confidence and faith to "demand from Christianity that it reform itself in the spirit of sincerity and with thoughtfulness, so it may become conscious of its true nature." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p>The best known of Albert Schweitzer's many books</p></p><h2>The Choose Yourself Guide to Wealth</h2><p>James Altrucher gives us his unconventional wisdom for personal success and wealth.</p><p></p><h2>Monsters of Pennsylvania: Mysterious Creatures in the Keystone State</h2><p>Pennsylvania is home to an assortment of odd creatures, and this volume features the best of the bunch.

The sheltered but rebellious daughter of bookish Midwestern parents, Weaver survived a repressive upbringing in the wealthy suburbs of Scarsdale and an early divorce to land in Greenwich Village just in time for the birth of rock 'n' roll and the counterculture movement known as the Beat Generation. Shortly after her arrival Kerouac, Ginsberg, and company old friends of her roommate arrive on their doorstep after a non-stop drive from Mexico. Weaver and Kerouac fall in love on sight, and Kerouac moves in.</p><p>" [Weaver] paints a romantic picture of Greenwich Village in the 1950s and '60s, when she worked in publishing and hung out with Allen Ginsberg and the poet Richard Howard and was wild and loose, getting high and falling into bed almost immediately with her crushes, including Lenny Bruce ... Her descriptions of the Village are evocative, recalling a time when she wore 'long skirts, Capezio ballet shoes and black stockings,' and used to 'sit in the Bagatelle and have sweet vermouth on the rocks with a twist of lemon.' Early on, she quotes Pasternak: 'You in others: this is your soul.' Kerouac's soul lives on through many people Joyce Johnson, for one but few have been as adept as Weaver at capturing both him and the New York bohemia of the time. He was lucky to have met her." Tara McKelvey, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p> There is a tendency for memoirs written by women about The Great Man to be self-abnegating exercises in a kind of inverted narcissism the author seeking to prove her worth as muse, as consort, as chosen one. Not so with Helen Weaver&#x2019;s beautiful, plainspoken elegy for her time spent with Jack Kerouac, who suddenly appeared at her door in the West Village one white, frosty morning with Allen Ginsberg, who knew Weaver&#x2019;s roommate, in tow." <i>New York Post</i></p> <p>"Helen Weaver&#x2019;s book was a revelation to me! ... This is the most graphic, honest, shameless, and moving documentary of what the newly liberated women in cities got up to how they lived, loved, and created. Who knew? It is time they did! And here&#x2019;s how." Carolyn Cassady</p><p>"Weaver recreates the excitement of a time when things were radically changing and shows us what it was like living with an eccentric genius at the turning point of his life. Eventually she asks Jack to leave but they remain friends, and over the years her respect for his writing grows even as Kerouac's reputation undergoes a gradual transition from <i>enfant terrible</i> to American icon. She comes to realize that by writing <i>On the Road</i> he woke America up&#x2014;along with her&#x2014;from the long dream of the fifties. And the Buddhist philosophy that once struck her as Jack's excuse for doing whatever he liked because 'nothing is real, it's all a dream' eventually becomes her own."</p><p>"Helen Weaver's memoir is a riveting account of her love affair and friendship with Jack Kerouac. She is both clear-eyed and passionate about him, and writes with truly amazing grace."

I couldn't put it down." David Amram</p><p>"A remarkable and intimate portrait of Greenwich Village in the fifties. The material on Kerouac, Ginsberg, Lenny Bruce, et al, provides a valuable and highly readable account of that important era. A wonderful and irreplaceable book, gracefully written with a sense of humor as well as of history." Dan Wakefield</p><p>"Weaver discovered herself in the 1950s, with Kerouac and other artists like Ginsberg and Lenny Bruce, and although most Americans don't have an impressive list of famous friends, her story is our story; every twenty-something college graduate experiences the ecstasy of new ideas and profound perception that comes with real life. Whether our is in New York City or Nowhere, USA, Weaver's experience is comparable to all our experiences in this country this is what makes <i>The Awakener</i> so readable and touching; these characters appear in every American's past." Meredith Boe</p><p>"This book does a good job of humanizing and demystifying the Beats. All the parties, problems, romances, brief affairs and hurt feelings Weaver talks about are specific to her and her friends in the '50s, but very much like the things my friends and I went through in the 70s, and that artistic young people are going through today while coming of age, groping for identity, finding love and making their way in the world." Dan Barth</p><p>"This book is evidence that the fifties had more going on than <i>Leave It to Beaver</i>. It's primarily the story of Helen Weaver&#x2019;s love affair with Jack Kerouac, but it also delves into her juicy romances with other lovers (of both genders), most notably Lenny Bruce. Weaver, who Kerouac portrayed as Ruth Heaper in <i>Desolation Angels</i>, had a whirlwind life outside of bed, too. She was involved with the publishing industry, was a French English translator, and fought for the legalization of marijuana. At twenty-five, Weaver got her first taste of Buddhism from Kerouac, but she wasn&#x2019;t yet ready for the first noble truth. Years later she read <i>The Miracle of Mindfulness</i>, by Thich Nhat Hanh, and felt that she had come home. That said, she admits, 'My own practice has never really taken hold, and in this I am a little like Jack.'" Andrea Miller</p><p>"<i>The Awakener's</i> first chapters are energized by Weaver's personal liberation at a time when America itself was starting to wake up. She smokes pot, explores the limits of her sexuality and defends Bill Haley's 'Rock Around the Clock' to high-minded literary pals like poet Richard Howard But the most touching moments in the book take place when Weaver focuses her keen powers of observation on the soul of her wounded hero Now 78 and living in Woodstock, she has come to appreciate the two-fold nature of his role as an awakener in her life. As a playful and enthusiastic lover, Kerouac helped initiate her into the richness of existence. And with his own Christianized version of the dharma, he made her aware of the brevity and preciousness of our time on Earth." Steve Silberman, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></p><p>"Weaver proves to be brilliantly honest throughout her memoir while placing readers in the thick of the New York Beat scene as only one who has lived it can. Her thoughtful reflection is rendered with loving care and great attention to detail, while transfixing the reader in a forgotten time. Through clear and straightforward language Weaver unapologetically places the real value of her experiences and her interpretations of those experiences ahead of the legends she encountered, while still paying them the tribute they deserve. It is a fine line to walk, but she does so gracefully and authentically." Candace Eros Diaz, <i>MARY Magazine</i></p><p>" a vivid recollection of the birth of rock n roll and the counterculture movement known as the Beat Generation I'd recommend it to anyone looking for insight into the undoing of America that occurred during the 50s and 60s." <i>Good Books in Bad Times</i></p><p>"A smart confidence underlies [Weaver's] bemused feminine understatement, and this book is a summation of a deeply thoughtful life." Levi Asher, <i>Literary Kicks</i></p><p>" a fascinating look at the private side of Jack Kerouac and other luminaries, the Beat's scene in 1950&#x2019;s New York, and the legacy of the Beat Generation." <i>Baby Got Books</i></p><p>" a memoir which a reader may cherish first because it recounts a life book-ended by two relationships with Jack Kerouac. But that reader will find Helen Weaver's remarkable life engaging, in its own right, as well. It is the story of a talented and spirited young woman growing up in the thick of her times an exceptional portrait of women at the cusp of the feminist era." Gilbert Wesley Purdy, <i>Eclectica</i></p><p>"There is a tendency for memoirs written by women about The Great Man to be self-abnegating exercises in a kind of inverted narcissism the author seeking to prove her worth as muse, as consort, as chosen one. Not so with Helen Weaver's beautiful, plainspoken elegy for her time spent with Jack Kerouac, who suddenly appeared at her door in the West Village one white, frosty morning with Allen Ginsberg, who knew Weaver's roommate, in tow." Maureen Callahan, <i>New York Post</i></p><p>"The book recounts her affair with Kerouac in 1956 during the period when he signed his literary contract for <i>On the Road</i>, but <i>The Awakener</i> is much more than a kiss-and-tell. It is at once a collection of remarkable, first-hand anecdotes about the Beats, an authoritative insight into the times from one who was on the front lines, and a coming-of-age story by the writer, who was immortalized in Kerouac's <i>Desolation Angels</i> as Ruth Heaper." Andrea Barrist Stern, <i>The Woodstock Times</i></p><p>"[Weaver's] new book is as much about Kerouac the meteor and its impact&amp;mdashas it is about her own ambling through the dales of the New York literary world Weaver has not forgotten the sexism that tainted even the enlightened Beats, but she speaks from the sunny side and is grateful for their energy and vision. Like Kerouac, she was drawn to bad boys and dictionaries it's easy to see why they were a match." Marx Dorrity, <i>Chronogram</i></p><p>"In the latest in a long line of kiss-and-tell memoirs about Jack Kerouac, Weaver, translator of over 50 books from the French, chronicles her brief love affair with the author against the backdrop of the 1950s in Greenwich Village. She works in publishing, undergoes psychoanalysis, and becomes part of a literary circle that includes Allen Ginsberg, Richard Howard, and Dan Wakefield. Unlike Kerouac, she is swept into the cultural revolution of the 1960s, embracing New Age ideas like Native American spirituality, goddess worship, witchcraft, and astrology. Weaver writes in a clear, straightforward style, candidly discussing her feelings about Kerouac and others, including her roommate Helen Elliott and her rival for Kerouac's affection, Joyce Johnson. Her analysis of Kerouac&#x2019;s life, work, and reputation is intelligent and on target. In the end, Weaver regrets that her own rejection of Kerouac paralleled that of a literary establishment that only came to appreciate him after his death. Verdict: Readers interested in the role of women in the Beat Generation will enjoy this book alongside earlier works like Joyce Johnson's <i>Minor Characters</i> and Carolyn Cassady's <i>Off the Road</i>." William Gargan, <i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"The most recent book to join the body of literature by women who lived with and among the famous Beat writers is Helen Weaver's <i>The Awakener: A Memoir of Kerouac and the Fifties</i> While Kerouac and the 1950s are a part of this book, they are not the entire book, or even its most riveting sections Parts of the book are indeed about Kerouac&#x2019;s power and influence. However, there are significant, insightful portraits of other men, including Richard Howard, one of the most important translators of the past 60 or so years, who has brought Stendhal, Baudelaire, de Beauvoir, and Camus into English. Weaver also writes evocatively about Lenny Bruce, the comedian and social critic who was tried for obscenity and convicted of obscenity, unlike Ginsberg and Burroughs Her style in <i>The Awakener</i> is distinctly her own, as for example when she borrows from both Yiddish and the Beat argot and describes herself as 'a little shiksa chick.' She has a wry, deadpan sense of humor and sometimes sounds tongue-in-cheek. Candidly, she describes her physical ailments, her love affairs in New York and in Europe including her orgasms and her therapy in Freudian analysis. Her strength is in psychology: understanding her own motives and the motivations and the motives of Kerouac and Ginsberg." Jonah Raskin, <i>The Beat Review</i></p><p>"Firsthand witness to the beat literary movement, Weaver (<i>Antonin Artaud: Selected Writings</i>) pays homage to the man and the writer Jack Kerouac, whom she met and fell in love with in 1956. Befriending Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and comic Lenny Bruce, she makes these iconic counterculture figures tangible and captures New York's Greenwich Village of the '50s and '60s. The memoir reveals the author's own awakening from discovering rock and roll through her personal sexual revolution to Buddhism. A lover of words and language, Weaver immortalized in Kerouac's <i>Desolation Angels</i> as Ruth Heaper writes this book 'as an act of atonement' to Kerouac: 'I rejected him for the same reason America rejected him: he woke us up in the middle of the night in the long dream of the fifties. He interfered with our sleep.' She moves from translator to writer, but states she is 'uncertain whether it was the story of my own life or the story of the remarkable people I had known.' Ultimately, it's both. Photos." <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"You won't read these stories anywhere else, and definitely not from someone with such an authentic voice I am absolutely convinced that anyone with an interest in the beat generation or even the 50s and 60s in general will fall in love with <i>The Awakener</i>, and with Helen Weaver." Rick Dale, <i>The Daily Beat</i></p><p>"Through her insightful prose and piercing honesty, she manages to paint a universal face with this book, telling the story of many-a-man living at an invisible edge. If anything, Helen Weaver wrote this book for all these human shadows who hunger to be held (but who always come to break the embrace before it becomes another cage)." John Aiello, <i>The Electric Review</i></p> <p>"Helen Weaver's moving, intelligent and clear-eyed memoir will capture the attention of many readers (as it should) because of her love affair with Jack Kerouac&#x2014;How many people can claim to have slept with Kerouac AND Lenny Bruce, by the way?&#x2014;but in fact her book is far more than merely a very sympathetic portrait of Kerouac, and of his friend Allen Ginsberg and of the people around them; it is at once a wonderfully intimate insider's description of a vanished age, an American Vie Boheme when all things seemed possible, that of the Beats, and of Greenwich Village in the 1950s, and a memoir which is never for one moment mean-spirited, and which is triumphantly honest and candid about herself, as likeable in these pages as she is in real life."&#x2014;Michael Korda, author of <em>Charmed Lives</em> and <em>Queenie</em></p> <p>"Helen Weaver's memoir is a riveting account of her love affair and friendship with Jack Kerouac.

By the author of Bitteroot Landing.</p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, April 1997</b>: Members of the Church of Fire and Brimstone and God's Almighty Baptizing Wind spend their days and nights serving the Lord and waiting for the Rapture--that moment just before the Second Coming of Christ when the saved will be lifted bodily to heaven and the damned will be left behind to face the thousand years of tribulation on earth. The tribulation, according to Grandpa Herman, founder of Fire and Brimstone, will be an ugly time: "He said that we'd run out of food. That big bugs would chase us around and sting us with their tails . . . He said we'd turn on the faucet in the bathroom and find only blood running out . . . He said evil multitudes would come unto us and cut off our limbs, and that we wouldn't die . . . And then he'd say, 'But you don't have to be left behind. You can go straight to Heaven with all of God's special children if you'll only open your hearts to Jesus . . .'" <p> Such talk of damnation weighs heavy on the mind of Ninah Huff, the 15-year-old narrator of Sheri Reynolds's second novel, <i>The Rapture of Canaan</i>. To distract her from sinful thoughts about her prayer partner James, Ninah puts pecan shells in her shoes and nettles in her bed. But concentrating on the Passion of Jesus cannot, in the end, deter Ninah and James from their passion for each other, and the consequences prove both tragic and transforming for the entire community. </p><p> <i>The Rapture of Canaan</i> is a book about miracles, and in writing it, Reynolds has performed something of a miracle herself. Although the church's beliefs and practices may seem extreme (sleeping in an open grave, mortifying the flesh with barbed wire), its members are complex and profoundly sympathetic as they wrestle with the contradictions of Fire and Brimstone's theology, the temptations of the outside world, and the frailties of the human heart.</p>Sheri Reynolds lives in Richmond and teaches part-time at Virginia Commonwealth University. She has also taught at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia.</p><h2>It all would have startled Columbus: A further mangling of American history that started with It all started with Columbus</h2><p>It all would have startled Columbus: A further mangling of American history that started with It all started with Columbus [hardcover] Armour, Richard Willard [Jan 01, 1976]</p><p></p><h2>Bedbugs: A Novel of Infestation</h2><p>FOR RENT: Top two floors of beautifully renovated brownstone, 1300 sq. ft., 2BR 2BA, eat-in kitchen, one block to parks and playgrounds.

This is one of the four novels in the series.</p><p></p><h2>Moral Purity and Persecution in History</h2><p><p>The intellectual scope and courage to contend with the largest puzzles of human existence and organization distinguish great social thinkers. Barrington Moore's Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy was a foundational work of historical sociology that influenced a generation of social scientists and, decades later, continues to be widely read and taught. Here, Moore takes up the same tools of historical comparison to investigate why groups of people kill and torture each other. His answer is arrestingly simple: people persecute those whom they perceive as polluting due to their "impure" religious, political, or economic ideas.</p><p>Moore's search begins with the Old Testament's restrictions on sexual behavior, idolatry, diet, and handling unclean objects. He argues that religious authorities seeking to distinguish the ancient Hebrews from competing groups invented, along with monotheism, the association of impure things with moral failure and the violation of God's will. This allowed people to view those holding competing ideas as contaminated and, more important, contaminating. Moore moves next to the French Wars of Religion, in which Protestants and Catholics massacred each other over the control of purity, and the French Revolution, which perfected terror and secularized purity. He then combs the major Asian religions and finds--to his surprise--that violent efforts to eradicate the "impure" were largely absent before substantial Western influence.</p><p>Moore's provocative conclusion is that monotheism--with its monopoly on virtue and failure to provide supernatural scapegoats--is responsible for some of the most virulent forms of intolerance and is a major cause of human nastiness and suffering. Moore does not say that the monotheist tradition was the primary source of Nazism, Stalinism, Maoism, violent Hindu fundamentalism, or ethnic cleansing in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, but he does identify it as an indispensable cause because it justified, encouraged, and spread vindictive persecution throughout the world.</p><p>Once again, Moore has drawn on his comprehensive understanding of history and talent for speaking directly to readers to address one of the most crucial questions about human past and future. This book is for anyone who has ever heard the word genocide and asked why.</p></p><p><p>"With the Iranian Pasdaran, the Afghan Taliban, and the American New Christian Right, Moore's concerns have deep contemporary resonance. He has, however, chosen to reflect on action against alleged impurity by reaching far back into history.... The result is a thought-provoking series of essays."<b>--Charles Tilly, Columbia University</b></p><p>"Barrington Moore delivers a powerful account of how Western civilization--in both its Christian and its secular revolutionary traditions--has nurtured a strong sense of divide between the pure 'we' and the impure and polluting 'enemy'. This, he compellingly argues, explains much of the mass murder so dominant in our history."<b>--Michael Mann, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><p>"Moore has, over many decades, demonstrated a knack for selecting original topics with timely significance. This book is no exception.... Justly celebrated for his analysis of the social structural determinants of political outcomes, Moore never lost sight of the importance of cultural factors. The constellation of ideas and beliefs that move people to action is an abiding theme in his life's work. Moral Purity reveals the extent to which cultural factors occupy a central place in Moore's approach to the study of popular movements. This is a stimulating, highly original set of essays by a master of comparative historical analysis with an extremely fertile sociological imagination."<b>--Victoria Bonnell, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><b>Barrington Moore, Jr.</b> is an internationally known scholar with a passion for understanding the reasons for conflict and oppression in human societies. He has served on the Harvard University faculty for more than 50 years, as a lecturer on sociology and as Senior Research Fellow at the Russian Research Center. He is the author of the landmark <i>Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peasant in the Making of the Modern World</i> and other books.</p><h2>Timberframe: The Art and Craft of the Post-and-Beam Home</h2><p>Timberframe shows that time-honored timber construction has unlimited design possibilities. Written by Tedd Benson, who is nationally known as the leader in timberframe design and construction, this vividly photographed book explores a variety of styles, from traditional homes to contemporary classics.</p><p>Unlike conventional framing, which is destined to be hidden by other building materials, timberframe homes leave massive beams and smaller supports exposed to be seen and admired as a finished and an architectural element. Tedd Benson divides <i>Timberframe: The Art and Craft of the Post-and-Beam Home</i> into four sections--"In the Country," "On the Water," "In the Mountains," and "In Addition"--to reveal how the proud owners of timberframe dwellings strive to make those architectural elements fit their surroundings. This is not a how-to book--though there are plenty of sketches and even a few simplified plans sprinkled among 400 color photos--as much as an effort to foster appreciation and inspiration of this unique home style. With case-by-case overviews of 29 American homes from coast to coast, Benson explores a craftsmanship that was largely replaced by stud framing in the late 1800s with the development of the wire nail, the circular saw mill, and the need to build houses more quickly. But Benson also calls attention to a renewed interest in timberframe dwellings. Norm Abram, of <i>This Old House</i> fame, not only wrote the foreword to this book but also serves as a case study of someone incorporating this old framing technique into his new house. For Abram, the attraction to timberframing is its sense of durability. "I look at its sturdiness and know it will be standing for many decades, maybe a century or two," he writes. Another sign of timberframing's resurgence is seen in the recent selling off of more than 7 million board feet of old-growth timber from the defunct Long-Bell Lumber mill in Longview, Washington. As Benson tells the story, word about the auction spread quickly among a new breed of timberframers who knew that wood of that size and quantity might never be seen again. The bidding quickly rose above the meager means of the average timberframer, and it was later learned that Bill Gates purchased the timbers for his multimillion-dollar home in Seattle. <i>--John Russell</i><p>Tedd Benson is the founder and owner of a post-and-beam construction firm in New Hampshire.

To preserve those memories, many hunters like to preserve their birds-be they Canada geese, mallards, wood ducks, bluebills, or teal-by taking them to a taxidermist and having them mounted for permanent display in dens or trophy rooms.<br>But having a bird professionally mounted can be expensive, so these days many hunters are opting to preserve ducks and geese themselves.

Challenging virtually every account of linguistic error in Freud&#x2019;s work as arbitrary and constrained, Sebastiano Timpanaro advances an alternative picture keyed to the dynamics of &#x201c;banalization,&#x201d; &#x201c;disimprovement,&#x201d; and contextual play borrowed from the field of literary criticism. Underscored with a Marxist defense of science against the professed materialism of the psychoanalytic &#x201c;individual drama,&#x201d; Timpanaro&#x2019;s analysis demands a strong reassessment of the Freudian legacy and a renewed debate over its value for the Left.</p><p><b>Sebastiano Timpanaro</b> was born in Parma in 1923 and died in 2000.

The readings explore the relationship between text and subtext as reflecting the relationship between the conscious and subconscious. On one level, this book is about Jacob&#39;s personal wrestling with his own angels and demons, his struggle to build a ladder between his own internal heaven and earth. On another level, it is about deceptions of ourselves and of others that threaten the fragile development of our identities. Settle back and enjoy this intellectually exhilarating exploration of dreams, Freudian slips, resistances and transference, as Jacob, mirroring everyman, wrestles with men and God and struggles to be blessed. Perhaps above all else, Wrestling Jacob introduces a new way to read the Bible, in which unusual word choices, odd syntax, and striking parallels conspire to reveal profound new meanings in an ancient text.</p><p>Rabbi Shmuel (Steven) Klitsner, a student of the late Nehama Leibowitz and co-author of the acclaimed novel The Lost Children of Tarshish, has trained a generation of Bible teachers at Jerusalem&#39;s Midreshet Lindenbaum College and at the London School of Jewish Studies.Klitsner's work is valuable - for its careful reading of the text, for its psychological insights, and for its incisive derash. Ultimately, the deep readings in this book are not about wordplay, psychology or intertextuality. Those are but tools available to the student of the text serving a greater purpose - to uncover the ultimate meaning of the stories. That message, according to Klitsner, relates to the struggle of biblical heroes caught in a "double bind of moral responsibility vs. covenantal destiny - evident when biblical characters try to advance the divine objective in ways that bypass their own integrity." Biblical heroes are expected to grow into a position in which their moral autonomy is paramount, regardless of what they perceive to be a prophetic imperative. The book explores "the tense and often contradictory relationship between what the divine plan seems to be and the implicit condemnation of dubious human machinations to bring about the divinely mandated result."<br><br>Regardless of whether one agrees or disagrees with specific interpretations offered in this volume, its overall moral message is a clarion call. In the end, it's not about our judgment of the biblical characters, but about what we can learn from them. --Zvi Grumet, Lookstein Digest<br><br>Too many Biblical commentaries today consider anomalies within the text of the Torah from either one of two extremes: as problems needing to be resolved, or as mistakes needing to be dismissed. In this fascinating new work, Rabbi Shmuel Klitsner proposes following a third approach: to consider these anomalies of syntax or grammar as the way that the Torah communicates both text and subtext. This approach, which the author ties to Freudian interpretation of language, allows Klitsner to find new meaning and motivation in the Genesis narrative....<br><br>Rabbi Klitsner is a master teacher whose knowledge and ability have created a scholarly work that will be of great value to bible scholar and layman alike. But even more, in this work he presents a paradigm of how to read a biblical text that can be applied to other texts beyond the scope of this current study. --Leonard A. Matanky, Jewish Book World<br><br>This is an innovative and scholarly work that deserves careful study. --Rabbi Shlomo Brody, Tradition Journal online</p><h2>Peace Like a River</h2><p>When Israel Finch and Tommy Basca, the town bullies, break into the home of school caretaker Jeremiah Land, wielding a baseball bat and looking for trouble, they find more of it than even they expected. For seventeen-year-old Davey is sitting up in bed waiting for them with a Winchester rifle. His younger brother Reuben has seen their father perform miracles, but Jeremiah now seems as powerless to prevent Davey from being arrested for manslaughter, as he has always been to ease Reuben&#39;s daily spungy struggle to breathe. Nor does brave and brilliant nine-year-old Swede, obsessed as she is with the legends of the wild west, have the strength to spring Davey from jail. Yet Davey does manage to break out. He steals a horse, and disappears. His family feels his absence so sorely, the three of them just pile into their old Plymouth, towing a brand new 1963 Airstream trailer, and set out on a quest to find him. And they follow the outlaw west, right into the cold, wild and empty Dakota Badlands. Set in the 1960s on the edge of the Great Plains, PEACE LIKE A RIVER is that rare thing, a contemporary novel with an epic dimension. Told in the touching voice of an asthmatic eleven-year-old boy, it revels in the legends of the West, resonates with a soul-expanding sense of place, and vibrates with the possibility of magic in the everyday world. Above all, it shows how family, love, and faith can stand up to the most terrifying of enemies, the most tragic of fates.</p><p>To the list of great American child narrators that includes Huck Finn and Scout Finch, let us now add Reuben "Rube" Land, the asthmatic 11-year-old boy at the center of Leif Enger's remarkable first novel, <i>Peace Like a River</i>. Rube recalls the events of his childhood, in small-town Minnesota circa 1962, in a voice that perfectly captures the poetic, verbal stoicism of the northern Great Plains. "Here's what I saw," Rube warns his readers. "Here's how it went. Make of it what you will." And Rube sees plenty. <p> In the winter of his 11th year, two schoolyard bullies break into the Lands' house, and Rube's big brother Davy guns them down with a Winchester. Shortly after his arrest, Davy breaks out of jail and goes on the lam. Swede is Rube's younger sister, a precocious writer who crafts rhymed epics of romantic Western outlawry. Shortly after Davy's escape, Rube, Swede, and their father, a widowed school custodian, hit the road too, swerving this way and that across Minnesota and North Dakota, determined to find their lost outlaw Davy. In the end it's not Rube who haunts the reader's imagination, it's his father, torn between love for his outlaw son and the duty to do the right, honest thing. Enger finds something quietly heroic in the bred-in-the-bone Minnesota decency of America's heartland. <i>Peace Like a River</i> opens up a new chapter in Midwestern literature. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>Leif Enger is 39 years old and lives with his wife and two young, sons on a farm in rural Minnesota.

After surviving a killer typhoon on the South China Sea, and accompanied by their eccentric elderly cousin, they set off across land to discover the treasures of Central Asia. Derrick befriends a fierce Mongol warrior and must help him battle a ruthless Chinese warlord. Given a gift of priceless jade, the group is pursued into the inhospitable mountains of Tibet where they are caught between fierce mountain monks and a terrifying unnamed creature that stalks then through the snow.</p><p><b>PATRICK O'BRIAN</b> (1914-2000) was born Richard Patrick Russ in England. During World War II, he and his wife were involved in British secret-service activities. After the war he changed his name to Patrick O'Brian. He began his career as a novelist, biographer, and translator. Starting in the 1990s, Mr. O'Brian, then in his seventies, achieved the critical and popular recognition that was his due.This stand-alone adventure novel from O'Brian (1914&#x2013;2000) saw British publication in 1954, before the Aubrey/Maturin historicals that made his name. In the years before WWII, the teenage Derrick, orphaned by his missionary parents, sails the China seas aboard the schooner <i>Wanderer</i> with his American uncle Terrence Sullivan (who is the captain), his elderly English cousin Ayrton (a professor of archeology) and Sullivan's business partner, Mr. Ross. Ayrton wants Derrick to leave the sea and attend school, but first they'll all embark on an archeological expedition to Samarcand (in what is now Uzbekistan). Marauding rebels capture Ross and Sullivan early on, and Ayrton (the most intriguing of the adult characters) pretends to be a Russian weapons expert to free them. Earthy, sly humor keeps the action set pieces perking along: frigid temperatures, militaristic Tibetan monks and even the Abominable Snowman await. Six decades later, O'Brian's richly told adventure saga, with its muscular prose, supple dialogue and engaging characters, packs a nice old-school punch. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Knights of St John, the fighting religious order drawn from most of the nations of Christendom had been driven from their island fortress of Rhodes 40 years earlier. From their new base of Malta their galleys had been so successful in their raids on Turkish shipping that the Sultan realised that only they stood between him and total mastery of the Mediterranean.

The analysis proceeds on the materialistic assumptions of modern science, but without prejudice to the underlying question as to the ulterior competency of this materialistic conception considered as a metaphysical tenet.

He is well known as a witty critic of capitalism. Veblen is famous for the idea of "conspicuous consumption." Conspicuous consumption, along with "conspicuous leisure," is performed to demonstrate wealth or mark social status. Veblen explains the concept in his best-known book, The Theory of the Leisure Class. Within the history of economic thought, Veblen is considered the leader of the institutional economics movement. Veblen's distinction between "institutions" and "technology" is still called the Veblenian dichotomy by contemporary economists.</p><p></p><h2>The Life and Death of My Mother</h2><p>Sitting beside his dying mother, the narrator recalls fragments of her life--her childhood in Louisiana, her marriage to a doctor, the death of her husband, and her retirement and illness--in an exploration of life, death, and the importance of family ties</p><p>In this bleak little book, psychiatrist/novelist Wheelis (The Doctor of Desire, 1987, etc.) offers a history of his dutiful but loveless relationship with his mother, an account of her death, and a pre-vision of his own life's end--which, at age 74, he feels to be imminent. Wheelis grew up in poverty in the American South, son of a doctor whose tuberculosis prevented him from working and who occupied all the attention of his wife, who chose to care for him at home. The author's childhood memories are of ugly things like sputum cups and sheets boiling in a cauldron in the backyard. When Wheelis's father died, the boy replaced him as the center of his mother's devotion, granting him a burdensome power over her. Guilt that Wheelis would feel the rest of his life arose from an incident when, as a preadolescent sleeping in bed with his mother, he explored her naked body as she slept. After that, he did his duty by her, with no joy and little love, nursed her through a spell of illness when he was in college, and invited her for long visits after he married, became a psychiatrist, and moved across the country--even though her dependency and devotion made him and his wife acutely uncomfortable. Wheelis's mother became, as he honestly but brutally says here, ``a foolish old woman'' while still in her 50s--and she remained so until her death in a nursing home nearly a half-century later. Is our dismal and often cruel existence, Wheelis wonders, unredeemed by any meaning after its end? He fantasizes returning to the dear scenes of his married life in the Pacific Northwest, and finds solace in the certainty that his survivors will love and miss him--as, to his grief, he never could manage to love his mother. A brave book, but a grim one. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>From the nursing home bed where his mother lay dying at the age of 100, San Francisco psychiatrist Wheelis ( The Path Not Taken ) looks back over the intense and, for him, often painful relationship they shared for his more than 70 years. Recalling how he, then a five-year-old, responded to her as she nursed his father through the grim final stages of TB and, later, as she struggled to make a life for him and his sister as an untrained schoolteacher in Texas, Wheelis focuses an unflinching eye on the powerful, subtly erotic dependency that she developed on him. As a young man, he cared for her through two serious illnesses and remained, married and with a family of his own, a loving and attentive son for all the decades that followed. Yet his discomfort with her adulation continued unabated and runs parallel to his awareness of his own mortality and, similarly, to the embellished image from his youth of a pigeon, its feet sadistically chopped off, forced to fly on and on because it cannot land. Wheelis's struggle to understand the place in his life of this woman--daughter, wife and mother of physicians--and the complex web of feelings she evokes in him yields a spare, unromanticized tale--compassionate, disturbing and masterfully told. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lost King of Oz (Wonderful Oz Books, No 19) (Wonderful Oz Books (Paperback))</h2><p><b>Return to L.

Though the plays are uneven in quality, they represent an important, underexplored group of theater voices. The editor's preface is a valuable survey of 20th century black women dramatists. Included are Beah Richards's A Black Woman Speaks, a landmark monologue; several strong dramas (e.g., Alice Childress's Wedding Band); and some successful experiments in form (e.g., Alexis DeVeaux's The Tapestry, Elaine Jackson's Paper Dolls). The weakest pieces are by the best-known writers and represent unfortunate choices by the editor: a scene from Lorraine Hansberry's Touissant and Ntozake Shange's Spell #7 . The best of these plays are not special pleading but put us in touch with real people struggling in a real world; they are of universal interest. Thomas E.

He slammed the car door shut and walked back into McGill&#x2019;s&#x2015;and immediately saw the whale at a table, sitting by himself, still wearing his trench coat and his stupid hat. Toby walked over to him and, without hesitating, shot him three times. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll teach you to fuck with me,&#x201d; he muttered.<p> <br><br>It was as if the sound of the gunshots woke him from a nightmare, and he suddenly realized what he&#x2019;d done. He stood for no more than a second looking at the fat man&#x2015;his white shirt was turning crimson&#x2015;then he ran. He almost hit a busboy carrying a tray of glasses before he got to the door, banged it open, jumped into his car, and took off. He was driving away less than a minute after he killed Dominic DiNunzio.</p><p> <br><br>As he was driving he kept saying, &#x201c;What did you do? What did you do?&#x201d; The short-barreled .357 was on the passenger seat, but it was no longer an inanimate object. To Toby it was alive, like a malignant machine in a Stephen King novel, giving off heat, possessing a dark, throbbing heart.</p></p><h2>Guide to Flags of the World (Firefly Pocket series)</h2><p><p> <i>The stories of nations as told through their flags.</i> </p><p> The <b>Firefly Guide to Flags of the World</b> is an authoritative and brightly illustrated guide to 193 national flags of every sovereign state and territory.

Home to an unrivaled twenty-five Nobel Prize winners and generation-defining authors like Tom Wolfe, Joan Didion, Philip Roth, and Jonathan Franzen, it&#x2019;s a cultural institution whose importance approaches that of <i>The New York Times</i>. But FSG is no ivory tower&#x2014;and its untold story is as engrossing as many of the great novels it has published.<br> <br>Boris Kachka reveals the era and the city that built FSG through the stories of two men: founder-owner Roger Straus, the black sheep of his German-Jewish family, and the reticent, closeted editor Robert Giroux, who rose from working-class New Jersey to discover the novelists and poets who helped define American culture. Giroux became one of T.S. Eliot&#x2019;s best friends and played caretaker to manic-depressive geniuses like Robert Lowell, John Berryman, and Jack Kerouac. Straus, the showman, made Susan Sontag a star, kept Edmund Wilson out of prison, and turned Isaac Bashevis Singer into a Nobelist.<br> <br>After giving us a fresh perspective on the postwar authors we thought we knew, Kachka exposes how elite publishing works today. He gets inside the editorial meetings where writers&#x2019; fates are decided; he captures the adrenaline rush of bidding wars for top talent; and he lifts the lid on the high-stakes pursuit of that rarest commodity, public attention&#x2014;including a fly-on-the-wall account of the confrontation between Oprah Winfrey and Jonathan Franzen.<br> <br><i>Hothouse</i> is the product of five years of research and nearly 200 interviews by a veteran <i>New York</i> magazine writer.

For the first time in years, Strieber revisits his encounter with alien intelligences-but now dramatically widens his search to explore how "the visitors" connect with today's persistent and globe-spanning reports of anomalous phenomena, such as crop circles, cattle mutilations, UFO sightings, alien abductions, near-death experiences, close encounters, and unexplained bodily implants.</p><p>In his magisterial style, Strieber contextualizes these bizarre and unsettling reports with his own childhood memories of strange schools, sinister experiments, and family secrets. In exploring today's most convincing cases of unexplained phenomena, Strieber reasons that they are not unrelated events. Nor are they the result of mass delusion. In some of his most persuasive writing, Strieber argues that the wave of mysterious episodes marks a transition that humanity is undergoing right now. Against all conscious understanding, we are experiencing a broadened awareness of dimensions of reality that exist beyond our current perceptions.</p></p><p><b>Whitley Strieber</b> is the internationally bestselling author of more than twenty novels and nonfiction works, including <i>The Wolfen, The Hunger</i>, and <i>The Coming Global Superstorm</i>, which was made into the feature film <i>The Day After Tomorrow</i>.

This survey includes her most famous pieces and discusses the ways in which her art challenges social values and the nature of art-making, and uses images appropriated from various sources to capture attention.</p><p>Provocative objects are the heart of Kruger's art work. Pairing banal or perplexing photographs with phrases superimposed directly over the image, she challenges the way in which the viewer's thoughts and attitudes are determined by the dictates of society. An example is her close-cropped depiction of an atomic mushroom cloud with the legend, "Your manias become science" across the stem of the cloud. A graphic designer and television critic, Kruger manipulates the commonplace to deconstruct the messages we absorb daily without reflection; in so doing she makes a stronger challenge to the established order than such controversial artists as Serrano and Mapplethorpe.

Whom do they eavesdrop on? And is the interception of communication an effective means of predicting and preventing future attacks? These are some of the questions at the heart of Patrick Radden Keefe&#x2019;s brilliant new book, Chatter. <br><br>In the late 1990s, when Keefe was a graduate student in England, he heard stories about an eavesdropping network led by the United States that spanned the planet. The system, known as Echelon, allowed America and its allies to intercept the private phone calls and e-mails of civilians and governments around the world. Taking the mystery of Echelon as his point of departure, Keefe explores the nature and context of communications interception, drawing together fascinating strands of history, fresh investigative reporting, and riveting, eye-opening anecdotes. The result is a bold and distinctive book, part detective story, part travel-writing, part essay on paranoia and secrecy in a digital age.<br><br>Chatter starts out at Menwith Hill, a secret eavesdropping station covered in mysterious, gargantuan golf balls, in England&#x2019;s Yorkshire moors. From there, the narrative moves quickly to another American spy station hidden in the Australian outback; from the intelligence bureaucracy in Washington to the European Parliament in Brussels; from an abandoned National Security Agency base in the mountains of North Carolina to the remote Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia. <br><br>As Keefe chases down the truth of contemporary surveillance by intelligence agencies, he unearths reams of little-known information and introduces us to a rogue&#x2019;s gallery of unforgettable characters. We meet a former British eavesdropper who now listens in on the United States Air Force for sport; an intelligence translator who risked prison to reveal an American operation to spy on the United Nations Security Council; a former member of the Senate committee on intelligence who says that oversight is so bad, a lot of senators only sit on the committee for the travel.<br><br>Provocative, often funny, and alarming without being alarmist, Chatter is a journey through a bizarre and shadowy world with vast implications for our security as well as our privacy. It is also the debut of a major new voice in nonfiction.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><b><br>Patrick Radden Keefe</b> was a Marshall Scholar and a 2003 fellow at the Dorothy and Lewis B.

Here, away from the world, amid rolling pastures, on a tract of land where the air is redolent of cow dung, lies the most sophisticated eavesdropping station on the planet. England&#x2019;s North Yorkshire moors are, after all, cow country. Leaving the elegant Victorian spa town of Harrogate, my taxi winds west through eight miles of verdant countryside. Just outside the city, the traffic thins, and what cars we pass seem to go much slower than they need to&#x2014;a deliberate, agrarian pace. Fields are set off by a network of hedges beneath a panoramic, cloudless sky. Sheep congregate here and there, and dozens of cows lounge by crumbling stone walls, some gazing as we whiz by, others chewing their cuds, oblivious.<br><br>I have been warned, seen photos&#x2014;I know what to expect. But as the first dome hovers into sight, I catch my breath. The bucolic road winds and rises and falls, and as we dip and rise again and crest a hill the tip of a great white sphere, shimmering in the summer heat, becomes visible in the distance. One giant dimpled dome, a great Kevlar golf ball. Then suddenly four domes, and then eight, as others float into view above the hill. A dip in the road and they&#x2019;re obscured again and then again in sight.<br><br>As the taxi rounds the perimeter fence, the base becomes visible in flashes through a row of trees. The white globes are called radomes, and each houses a satellite dish antenna, protecting it from the elements and masking its orientation&#x2014;the dome itself is just a kind of skin. I count twenty-eight of these domes in all, ghostly white against the green of the countryside. They look otherworldly.<br><br>And in a sense, they are. The dishes are hidden inside the radomes because their supersensitive antennae are trained on a corresponding set of satellites hovering more than twenty thousand miles above. Some of those are communications satellites that transmit secure messages to other intelligence installations around the world. Some are spy satellites, which take photographs, intercept communications, and use Global Positioning Systems to pinpoint the locations of various individuals or vehicles around the planet. And some of the satellites are regular commercial communications satellites, the kind that transmit your telephone calls and Internet traffic across the oceans. The first two varieties of satellite were built specifically to correspond with the base. This third kind, however, was not. These satellites are managed by a company called Intelsat, and the signals they relay are private, civilian communications. But the base collects these signals, too, soundlessly and ceaselessly intercepting great flows of private communications every minute of every hour. The sign at the gate reads: RAF Menwith Hill.<br><br>I approach the sandbagged entrance, smile at the grave British military policemen who stand guard, and peer inside. RAF stands for Royal Air Force, but the name is a deliberate misnomer. The base was built in the 1950s on land purchased by the British Crown, but in 1966 the site was taken over by the American National Security Agency. Thus while the station is nominally an RAF base, it is actually home to more than twelve hundred Americans. These people live in housing within the perimeter of the fence, send their children to primary and secondary school within the fence, use their own grocery store, post office, sports center, pub, and bowling alley, all within the fence. The bowling alley, in a questionable piece of nomenclature for a base that is instrumental to America&#x2019;s nuclear program, is called the Strike Zone. There are houses and a chapel and a playground and a full-sized track and baseball diamond. The whole base covers 560 acres. Beneath a curling ribbon of razor wire, armed men with dogs patrol the fence.<br><br>While we are accustomed, in this age of American power projection, to the idea of full-time military personnel living in this type of enclave abroad, I was surprised to learn that the majority of the employees at Menwith Hill are in fact civilians: engineers, technicians, mathematicians, linguists, and analysts. The NSA has always employed large numbers of civilian contractors: professionals, generally with technical expertise, who satisfy the rigorous background tests and security clearances to work at the forefront of the most secret field in American intelligence. These people come from aerospace and technology firms that do regular contract work for the government. They move their belongings and their families to the base, drawn by the allowances made for them: free housing, free shipping of their furniture and cars, and most of all, a tax-free salary. They work in three eight-hour shifts, so that the great interception machine does not shut down. They work Christmas and New Year&#x2019;s Day, and through the routine protests outside the gates of the base on the Fourth of July. There are linguists trained in Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew, and the gamut of European languages. With another four hundred or so personnel from the British Ministry of Defence, this single quietly humming spy station, which the vast majority of British and American civilians have never heard of, has a staff as large as all of Britain&#x2019;s storied domestic-intelligence service, MI5.<br><br>At the Black Bull Inn, a local pub, the night before my visit to the base, a couple of teenagers drinking pints of bitter and eating chicken curry&#x2013;flavored potato chips at the bar joked about the carloads of beautiful young American women, &#x201c;the Menwith Hill girls,&#x201d; whom they occasionally see. The women drive American cars with the steering wheel on the left and head out to pubs in surrounding villages or into Harrogate or York on the weekends, before returning to disappear behind the fence. If the social life of these women has the quality of an apparition to the locals, their professional life is even more obscure. One of the boys at the bar, reed thin with dark hair and an eyebrow ring, said he had worked at &#x201c;the Hill&#x201d; for a while, in the cafeteria, but that the base was segregated into the Upper Hill and the Lower Hill, that there was a strict division between the living areas and the working areas, and that his security clearance, which in and of itself had required a battery of forms, questions, checks, and tests, was inadequate to let him get anywhere near the real activity on the base. He said that as far as he could tell, much of the work happens in the untold stretches of the Hill that are underground. &#x201c;But from what I hear,&#x201d; he said, raising a conspiratorial brow and eyeing my notebook to make sure I was getting this, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s an alien-testing zone.&#x201d; His mates cackled at this, and all the louder when they saw me dutifully scribbling it down.<br><br>I stand at the entrance and, craning my neck, gaze through the fence. The guards are toting machine guns and look at me with idle curiosity. A digital screen by a cluster of low buildings flashes messages to cars driving into the base. Raike and Massage Tuesday Night . . . Geico Insurance Every Thursday . . . Karaoke Thursday Night . . . Drinking and Driving Wrecks Lives.<br><br>&#x201c;Pardon me, sir,&#x201d; one of the guards clears his throat. He nods to indicate something behind me.<br><br>A blue sedan is idling, waiting to get past. I move aside. The driver is a young woman in a sweatshirt, her hair pulled back. We make eye contact for a second. She&#x2019;s about my age&#x2014;a Menwith Hill girl! The guards wave her through, and she&#x2019;s gone.<br><br>Inside the fence, in one-story, windowless buildings and in high-tech underground basements, the Menwith Hill girls join their colleagues in the clandestine interception of billions of communications per day. It has been claimed that all telecommunications traffic in and out of Europe that passes through Britain is intercepted by the base.<br><br> This is the inscrutable face of American intelligence in the twenty-first century. When the Iron Curtain fell, it ruptured the fixed geography of Europe and the world, unleashing a slow tectonic shift that continues to alter the geopolitical landscape to this day. The end of the cold war also changed the nature of intelligence activities for the United States and its allies. The decentralization of the threat that had been posed by the Soviets, combined with a reduced defense budget, a new sense of optimism, and a diminished American tolerance for military casualties, led to a pronounced reduction in the number of human spies on the ground. Gone are the trench-coated cold warriors of John le Carr� novels, the CIA spies who were at the vanguard of cold war intelligence, sent to infiltrate the opposition or work out of embassies, recruit moles and double agents, and risk their lives in the process. Human intelligence, or Humint, was already in a steady decline by the end of the cold war, and it continued to dwindle as an American priority through the 1990s. In 1998, Porter Goss, the Florida congressman and former CIA case officer who was the chairman of the House of Representatives&#x2019; Intelligence Committee and in September 2004 was appointed director of the CIA, declared simply, &#x201c;It is fair to say that the cupboard is nearly bare in the area of human intelligence.&#x201d;<br><br>But while American politicians were unwilling to sacrifice the lives of spies in countries that no longer played a decisive role against the Soviets or those of soldiers in places such as Mogadishu or Sarajevo, they were more than willing to invest in new technologies to fight wars and gather intelligence, as it were, by remote control. In a succession of conflicts, the George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations made it clear that the United States, wherever possible, would prefer to use gadgets instead of humans. In the words of former CIA operative Robert Baer, &#x201c;The theory was that satellites, the Internet, electronic intercepts, even academic publications wou...</p><h2>Maigret&#39;s War of Nerves</h2><p>Convinced that Joseph Heurtin, a slow-witted delivery boy, did not commit a brutal murder, Inspector Jules Maigret&#39;s quest for the real killer plunges him into a battle of wits with a criminal mastermind</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)Expertly translated by Sainsbury, this novel remains as intensely absorbing as when it first appeared in 1939. Here again is Inspector Maigret, guided by humane feelings behind his stolid facade, putting himself at grave risk to arrange the escape of a condemned man from prison. Judged guilty and awaiting execution for the killing of a rich American woman, Mrs. Henderson, and her maid, Joseph Heurtin is innocent, as Maigret suspects. Unaware that the police have deliberately let him escape, Heurtin dodges about the streets, leading the inspector and his detectives to cafes where they observe their quarry's interest in Henderson's free-spending heir and the women with him, as well as Heurtin's concentration on a penniless, eccentric student. The results of Maigret's scheme are utterly unexpected. Without one unnecessary word, Simenon brings all the characters to life and keeps the reader engrossed right up to the shattering denouement. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Falling</h2><p><b>A brilliant debut psychological thriller by a former police psychologist.

With characteristically spare prose, Caldecott Honor winner Peter McCarty invites readers along for an imaginary trip from the earth to the moon and back again, visiting trains, planes, and boats along the way.

He lives with his wife and two children in upstate New York.*Starred Review* A small boy stands in a field of tall grass. Looking up at an airplane flying through the sky, he imagines what it would be like on that flight--to fly faster than a car can go, to soar past a train, to burst into space. He imagines stepping off the plane onto the surface of the moon, where, when he jumps, his weightlessness will make him fly. But soon he must bring himself back to the plane, back to Earth, where his mother is waiting for him. The simple text (with its ending a gentle reminder of Sendak's <i>Where </i>the Wild Things Are) appears one brief line to a page. Though this idea (and it's more an idea than a story) will catch kids' imagination, it is only when combined with McCarty's art that it soars. Using pencils, McCarty creates soft-edged, silver-tone artwork notable for its elegant simplicity. Yet this is undoubtedly child-friendly. The train, the plane, and even the surface of the moon have a solidity that will make children want to reach out and touch, even as the pictures' dreamy softness will move kids to a space inside themselves. McCarty catches both the way children's imaginations work and the connections they make. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

LJ. AB. NYT. K.</p><p>Pratchett (of Discworld fame) and Gaiman (of Sandman fame) may seem an unlikely combination, but the topic (Armageddon) of this fast-paced novel is old hat to both. Pratchett&#39;s wackiness collaborates with Gaiman&#39;s morbid humor; the result is a humanist delight to be savored and reread again and again. You see, there was a bit of a mixup when the Antichrist was born, due in part to the machinations of Crowley, who did not so much fall as saunter downwards, and in part to the mysterious ways as manifested in the form of a part-time rare book dealer, an angel named Aziraphale. Like top agents everywhere, they&#39;ve long had more in common with each other than the sides they represent, or the conflict they are nominally engaged in. The only person who knows how it will all end is Agnes Nutter, a witch whose prophecies all come true, if one can only manage to decipher them. The minor characters along the way (Famine makes an appearance as diet crazes, no-calorie food and anorexia epidemics) are as much fun as the story as a whole, which adds up to one of those rare books which is enormous fun to read the first time, and the second time, and the third time..."A Superbly funny book.

If only Dolly&#x2019;s mother had been a round, bunlike woman, or a small wrinkled person, it might have been easier for Dolly, this business of growing up. But no, there were no consolations on that score. Mother was tall and willowy and had a smile that made other people smile too and a laugh that caused strangers to look up with pleasure. Mother always knew what to say and said it; Mother wore long lilac silk scarves so elegantly they seemed to flow with her when she walked. If Dolly tried to wear a scarf, either it looked like a bandage or else she got mistaken for a football fan. If you were square and solid and without color or grace, it was sometimes easy to hate Mother.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But only for a moment, and not real hate. Nobody could hate Mother, and certainly not the dumpy daughter that Mother treated like a princess. She always spoke of Dolly&#x2019;s fine points. Her lovely deep--green eyes. People will get lost in those eyes, Mother had said. Dolly doubted it&#x2014;-there was precious little sign of anyone looking into them for long enough to realize that they were green, let alone run the risk of sinking hopelessly into their depths. Mother always called on Father to admire Dolly&#x2019;s wonderful texture of hair. &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; Mother would say excitedly. &#x201c;Look at how thick it is and how healthy it is; we may well see the shampoo companies begging Doll to do advertisements for them.&#x201d; Father would look obediently and with some mild surprise as if he had been called to see a kingfisher that had just disappeared. He would nod eagerly to please his wife and daughter. Oh, yes, he would agree. A fine shock of hair, all right, no molting there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dolly would examine her dull brown hair without pleasure. The only thing to be said in its favor was that there was a lot of it. And that was what Mother had unerringly been able to identify and fasten on in her extravagant compliments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All the girls at school loved Dolly&#x2019;s mother&#x2014;-she was so friendly they said, so interested in them. She remembered all their names. They loved coming round to the house on Chestnut Street on Saturday afternoons. Dolly&#x2019;s mother used to let them play with her old makeup. Ends of lipsticks, little, nearly empty pots of eye shadow, compacts almost worn away by dabbing. There was a big mirror with a good light where they could practice; all Dolly&#x2019;s mother insisted was that every trace of it be removed with cold cream and tissues before they went home. She managed to make them believe that this was what kept the skin healthy and fresh, and Dolly&#x2019;s friends enjoyed the cleansing almost as much as they had liked the painting of their young faces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dolly&#x2019;s friends. Were they really friends, she often wondered, or did they just like her because of Mother? At school they didn&#x2019;t make much of her. After class Dolly often sat alone while others went off arm in arm. She was never the center of any laughing crowd in the playground, nobody chose her to go shopping after school, she was usually one of the last to be picked for any team. Even poor Olive, who was fat and had thick, whirly round spectacles, often got picked before Dolly. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for Mother she might have sunk without trace in that school. She should be very, very grateful that, unlike almost everyone else around her, she had a parent who was universally approved and liked. She should be grateful, and she usually was. She was happiest playing with her cat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mother always baked a funny cake for the sale of work, not a big showy one that would embarrass you or a little mean one that would make you feel ashamed, but like the one covered in Smarties, or the one with nasturtium flowers on it and a cutting from a newspaper saying that they were safe to eat. Mother had lent marvelous things for the school play and hadn&#x2019;t complained when they got torn. Mother had asked Miss Power for the knitting pattern of her cardigan, and then had actually gone and knitted the thing, telling Miss Power that she had chosen a different color in case they looked like identical twins. Poor Miss Power, plain as a pikestaff and not willowy and lovely like Mother, had pinked with pleasure and had become nearer to human than any of them had ever seen her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For Dolly&#x2019;s sixteenth birthday, Mother was making a marvelous production. And every step of the way she consulted her daughter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Now, you must tell me what you&#x2019;d like and what the other girls do. There&#x2019;s nothing so silly as a mother getting it all wrong, and taking you to the pictures and McDonald&#x2019;s when that&#x2019;s far too young for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d never get it wrong, Mother,&#x201d; Dolly said in a dead sort of voice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;But of course I would, darling Doll. I&#x2019;m a hundred years older than you and all your friends. I have ideas from the last century. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m relying on you to say what you want.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t a hundred years older than us.&#x201d; Dolly&#x2019;s tone was level. &#x201c;You were twenty--three when I was born; you&#x2019;re not forty yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, but soon will be.&#x201d; Mother sighed and looked at her perfect face in the mirror. &#x201c;Soon a wizened, stooped, eccentric old forty--year--old.&#x201d; She pealed with laughter and Dolly laughed too. The notion was so ridiculous.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What did you do when you were sixteen?&#x201d; Dolly asked, trying to put off the moment when she would have to say she didn&#x2019;t know how to stage the celebration, and was dreading it in any form.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, love, that was so long ago. And it was a Friday, so we all did what everyone did then&#x2014;-we watched <i>Ready, Steady, Go!</i> on the television, and we had sausages and a birthday cake and we played all the Beatles on my record player. And then we went to a coffee bar and drank cups of frothy coffee and giggled and everyone went home on the bus.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It sounds lovely,&#x201d; Dolly said wistfully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it was the Dark Ages,&#x201d; Mother admitted ruefully. &#x201c;Nowadays things are much more advanced. I suppose you&#x2019;ll all want to go to a disco? What did the others do? Jenny&#x2019;s sixteen, Mary must be sixteen, Judy?&#x201d; Mother looked at her brightly, listing the names of Dolly&#x2019;s friends, alert and interested. Caring that her daughter should not be left out of whatever was the scene.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I think Jenny just went out to the pictures,&#x201d; Dolly said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course she had Nick&#x2014;-that&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; Dolly&#x2019;s mother nodded sagely. She was the confidante of all the girls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what Judy did.&#x201d; Dolly was mulish.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;But you must, darling. She&#x2019;s your friend.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mother&#x2019;s face softened visibly. Dolly could see a change of approach. The note was soothing now. &#x201c;Of course, of course, and let&#x2019;s not forget she may have done nothing at all. Or just had a family gathering. No, there&#x2019;s no reason why you should know.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dolly felt worse than ever now. She was revealed to Mother as a person whose friends had celebrations without her, but as someone so pathetic that she had to give some kind of cringe--making party herself so as to buy their friendship. Dolly&#x2019;s heart was heavy. She knew her face looked heavy and sad as well. She wished she could smile for this bright and lovely mother who was trying to help her, who had always been there supporting and suggesting and admiring. But the smile wouldn&#x2019;t come to her face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mother would have every reason to play the martyr, to feel that her daughter was monstrously ungrateful. But Mother never behaved like that. Judy&#x2019;s mother was constantly saying that daughters were a scourge to the flesh and a torment to the soul. Jenny&#x2019;s mother was like a Special Branch officer, so suspicious was she of even the most innocent activities. Mary&#x2019;s mother looked like a medieval painting of a mourning Madonna; she seemed stooped under the weight of her responsibility for a teenage girl. Only Dolly&#x2019;s mother was full of hope and plans and enthusiasm. Wasn&#x2019;t it bad luck that when the cards were being given out she had been dealt dull old Dolly instead of someone more colorful and lively who could respond.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you so nice to me, Mother?&#x201d; Dolly asked seriously. She really and truly wanted to know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mother&#x2019;s face showed hardly any surprise at the question. She answered it as cheerfully and with the same kind of smile that greeted almost everything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not being nice, darling, I&#x2019;m being ordinary&nbsp;. . . but it&#x2019;s your sixteenth birthday and that should be a happy day, something you&#x2019;ll remember&nbsp;. . . even if it&#x2019;s silly, like mine was. At least I remember it, and all our idiotic clothes and hairstyles. That&#x2019;s what I want you to have, a happy day.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dolly thought for a moment. Every single one of the girls who had been to their house had praised Mother. They had all said she was like a marvelous big sister&#x2014;-you could tell her anything, she always understood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Mother, don&#x2019;t bother. Honestly. It won&#x2019;t <i>be</i> a happy day. There aren&#x2019;t any happy days. Honestly. Days just aren&#x2019;t happy like they were for you, like they are for you. I&#x2019;m not complaining. It&#x2019;s just the way it is.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She willed her eyes not to fill with tears, she prayed for some understanding to come on her mother&#x2019;s face. What came was a look of great concern, but Dolly knew that it wasn&#x2019;t real understanding. It was just more of the same. Like it had always been.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mother&#x2019;s words washed over her, reassurance, everyone feeling down when they were fifteen, being neither old nor young, more reassurances, soon everything would look rosy again, Dolly&#x2019;s beautiful green eyes would shine again, her lovely thick, shiny hair would fly about her as she raced off, full of excitement about life and all the adventures it held. . .&nbsp;. Dolly sat there glumly as her mother stroked her hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She looked down at Mother&#x2019;s long, thin white fingers with their perfect, long shell--pink nails, she saw Mother&#x2019;s rings, not very huge in themselves but making Mother&#x2019;s little hand seem still frailer by having to bear them. The hand stroked Dolly&#x2019;s square hands, with their bitten nails, their ink stains and the scratches from the blackberry bush.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dolly knew that the fault was hers, Mother was so good; it was Dolly who was rotten. Rotten and ungiving to her core. Right to the base of her hard, square, unattractive heart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Father often looked melancholy, Dolly thought, a little stooped and tired as he walked up the hill from the railway station carrying his briefcase, but as soon as he saw Mother he cheered up. She might wave to him from an upstairs window and then run lightly down the stairs to embrace him when he came in the door. She didn&#x2019;t peck at him; she threw both her arms around him and encircled him, briefcase, overcoat, evening paper and all. Or else she might be in the kitchen, where she would drop everything and run to him. Dolly saw how pleased and even slightly surprised he was each time. He was not given to such spontaneous gestures himself, but he responded like a flower opening to the sun. The worried look of the commuter tired after a day&#x2019;s work disappeared. Mother never laid any problems on him the moment he arrived. If there had been a burst pipe he heard about it later. Much later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And so, as Dolly knew would happen, the subject of the sixteenth birthday was raised as an excitement, not a problem. Mother&#x2019;s eyes shone with the excitement of it. A girl turning sixteen&#x2014;-it was a symbol, a landmark, a milestone. It had to be marked. <i>What</i> would they do to make the day marvelous for Dolly?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dolly saw Father&#x2019;s face become tender. Father too must know of other households where the mothers were not as Mother was here. Where there was strife about children having any kind of party. How blessed he was to have the single exception, to have married the only woman in the world who positively relished a celebration for teenage girls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, now.&#x201d; He beamed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a lucky girl and there&#x2019;s no doubt about that, Dolly. Well, well, a sixteenth party no less.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind if we can&#x2019;t afford it,&#x201d; Dolly began.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course we can afford it. What else do we work for, your mother and I, except to be able to afford the odd little treat like this.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Again, Dolly found herself guiltily wondering, Could this possibly be true? Did Father go out that long journey to the faceless office and come back tired every evening so that he could afford birthday parties? Surely not. And Mother, who went to work mornings in a big florist shop, was it all for a nest egg so that they could have these kinds of treats? Dolly had always thought Mother liked being among the beautiful flowers, and having lunch with her friends there and getting tired flowers to take home, where they often came to life again. She thought that Father went to work because it was what men did. They stayed in the office and dealt with files. She realized she must be very stupid about a lot of things. No wonder she couldn&#x2019;t have these great conversations with people, like Mother did. Only the other day she had heard Mother talking to the postman about happiness. Imagine talking about something as huge as happiness to a man who came to deliver the letters. And he had seemed very interested and said that not enough people ever took those kind of things into consideration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Mother, I&#x2019;m bad at knowing what people like and what they want. You are very good at it. What do <i>you</i> think my friends would like?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dolly felt about as low as she had ever felt. And who in the world would have an ounce of sympathy for her? A spoiled brat, is what they would say she was. A girl who was being offered everything and could accept nothing. Mother didn&#x2019;t know any of these thoughts. She was too busy being helpful. &#x201c;What about a lunch?&#x201d; she said suddenly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;A Saturday lunch at the Grand Hotel&#x2014;-you could all dress up and you could have one bottle of wine between all of you, if you have lots and lots of mineral water. . .&nbsp;. You could order from the menu&nbsp;. . . choose what you like. . .&nbsp;. How about that?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It had definite possibilities. It was so utterly different.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Would you come with us?&#x201d; Dolly asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nonsense, darling, your friends wouldn&#x2019;t want an old fogy like me&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Please, Mother,&#x201d; Dolly begged.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mother said that since she would be working on Saturday, well she could wear a silly hat and just drop in and join them for a drink&nbsp;. . . or whatever.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dolly&#x2019;s friends thought it was a great idea. Jenny said she would wear her new outfit and it would make Nick sick as a parrot to know she had been lunching at the Grand. Mary said she&#x2019;d go and grab a look at the menu so they&#x2019;d know what to order. Judy said there might be film scouts there or men who ran model agencies. They said Dolly&#x2019;s mother was a genius...</p></p><h2>Spectrum: The First Annual Collection of the Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art</h2><p>This lavishly illustrated book features the work of today&#39;s best-selling creators of fantasy and science fiction art.

Indeed, at the height of Watergate, he was Nixon&#39;s lawyer. The part of this book that covers those White House years is elevated above the norm by Garment&#39;s honest, human presence--after all, this is the guy who advised Nixon not to destroy the Oval Office tapes. His humanity comes to the fore in the parts that cover his non-Watergate political forays, his pre-law career as a professional jazz musician, and his personal psychological difficulties. Yet, in his account of his life as a Washington fixer, the mark of Milhous is still visible. When he describes being the lawyer for a Reagan administration official who routinely taped phone calls without the knowledge of those on the other end of the line, Garment pooh-poohs the laws banning this practice and is a little too gleeful about the course of action he had his client take: destroying the tapes.<b>Leonard Garment</b> was a senior staffer to Richard Nixon. In the wake of the Watergate scandal, Garment filled the role of Counsel to the President left vacant by Haldeman and Ehrlichman. After Nixon's resignation, he continued moving in Washington legal and political circles, eventually turning his attention to writing. His book <i>Crazy Rhythm: My Journey from Brooklyn, Jazz, and Wall Street to Nixon's White House, Watergate, and Beyond</i> was published in 1977 to wide acclaim.</p><h2>Secret Asian Man: The Daily Days</h2><p><p>After ten years of writing and illustrating the critically acclaimed comic strip series <i>Secret Asian Man</i>, Tak Toyoshima has put together his first book of strips. <b><i>Secret Asian Man: The Daily Days</i></b> collects every single daily comic strip he produced for over two years of syndication with United Features.</p> <br> <p><i>Secret Asian Man</i> is a comic strip that focuses on what makes us the same as well as different, through the lens of Asian American protagonist Osamu SAM Takahashi.

In the window he sees a West Point class ring from 2005. It&#39;s tiny. It&#39;s a woman cadet&#39;s graduation present to herself. Why would she give it up? Reacher&#39;s a West Pointer too, and he knows what she went through to get it. Reacher tracks the ring back to its owner, step by step, down a criminal trail leading west. Like Big Foot come out of the forest, he arrives in the deserted wilds of Wyoming. All he wants is to find the woman. If she&#39;s OK, he&#39;ll walk away. If she&#39;s not ... he&#39;ll stop at nothing. He&#39;s still shaken by the recent horrors of Make Me, and now The Midnight Line sees him set on a raw and elemental quest for simple justice.

On the fourth morning she was gone. Reacher came back to the room with coffee and found a note on his pillow. He had seen such notes before. They all said the same thing. Either directly or indirectly. Chang&#x2019;s note was indirect. And more elegant than most. Not in terms of presentation. It was a ballpoint scrawl on motel notepaper gone wavy with damp. But elegant in terms of expression. She had used a simile, to explain and flatter and apologize all at once. She had written, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re like New York City. I love to visit, but I could never live there.&#x201d;<br><br>He did what he always did. He let her go. He understood. No apology required. He couldn&#x2019;t live anywhere. His whole life was a visit. Who could put up with that? He drank his coffee, and then hers, and took his toothbrush from the bathroom glass, and walked away, through a knot of streets, left and right, toward the bus depot. She would be in a taxi, he guessed. To the airport. She had a gold card and a cell phone.<br><br>At the depot he did what he always did. He bought a ticket for the first bus out, no matter where it was going. Which turned out to be an end-�of-�the-�line place way north and west, on the shore of Lake Superior. Fundamentally the wrong direction. Colder, not warmer. But rules were rules, so he climbed aboard. He sat and watched out the window. Wisconsin flashed by, its hayfields baled and stubbly, its pastures worn, its trees dark and heavy. It was the end of summer.<br><br>It was the end of several things. She had asked the usual questions. Which were really statements in disguise. She could understand a year. Absolutely. A kid who grew up on bases overseas, and was then deployed to bases overseas, with nothing in between except four years at West Point, which wasn&#x2019;t exactly known as a leisure-�heavy institution, then obviously such a guy was going to take a year to travel and see the sights before he settled down. Maybe two years. But not more. And not permanently. Face it. The pathology meter was twitching.<br><br>All said with concern, and no judgment. No big deal. Just a two-�minute conversation. But the message was clear. As clear as such messages could be. Something about denial. He asked, denial of what? He didn&#x2019;t secretly think his life was a problem.<br><br>That proves it, she said.<br><br>So he got on the bus to the end-�of-�the-�line place, and he would have ridden it all the way, because rules were rules, except he took a stroll at the second comfort stop, and he saw a ring in a pawn shop window.<br><br>The second comfort stop came late in the day, and it was on the sad side of a small town. Possibly a seat of county government. Or some minor part of it. Maybe the county police department was headquartered there. There was a jail in town. That was clear. Reacher could see bail bond offices, and a pawn shop. Full service, right there, side by side on a run-�down street beyond the restroom block.<br><br>He was stiff from sitting. He scanned the street beyond the restroom block. He started walking toward it. No real reason. Just strolling. Just loosening up. As he got closer he counted the guitars in the pawn shop window. Seven. Sad stories, all of them. Like the songs on country radio. Dreams, unfulfilled. Lower down in the window were glass shelves loaded with smaller stuff. All kinds of jewelry. Including rings. Including class rings. All kinds of high schools. Except one of them wasn&#x2019;t. One of them was West Point 2005.<br><br>It was a handsome ring. It was a conventional shape, and a conventional style, with intricate gold filigree, and a black stone, maybe semi-�precious, maybe glass, surrounded by an oval hoop that had West Point around the top, and 2005 around the bottom. Old-�style letters. A classic approach. Either respect for bygone days, or a lack of imagination. West Pointers designed their own rings. Whatever they wanted. An old tradition. Or an old entitlement, perhaps, because West Point class rings had been the first class rings of all.<br><br>It was a very small ring.<br><br>Reacher wouldn&#x2019;t have gotten it on any of his fingers. Not even his left-�hand pinky, not even past the nail. Certainly not past the first knuckle. It was tiny. It was a woman&#x2019;s ring. Possibly a replica for a girlfriend or a fianc�e. That happened. Like a tribute or a souvenir.<br><br>But possibly not.<br><br>Reacher opened the pawn shop door. He stepped inside. A guy at the register looked up. He was a big bear of a man, scruffy and unkempt. Maybe in his middle thirties, dark, with plenty of fat over a big frame anyway. With some kind of cunning in his eyes. Certainly enough to perfect his response to his sudden six-�five two-�fifty visitor. Driven purely by instinct. The guy wasn&#x2019;t afraid. He had a loaded gun under the counter. Unless he was an idiot. Which he didn&#x2019;t look. All the same, the guy didn&#x2019;t want to risk sounding aggressive. But he didn&#x2019;t want to sound obsequious, either. A matter of pride.<br><br>So he said, &#x201c;How&#x2019;s it going?&#x201d;<br><br>Not well, Reacher thought. To be honest. Chang would be back in Seattle by then. Back in her life.<br><br>But he said, &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t complain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can I help you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Show me your class rings.&#x201d;<br><br>The guy threaded the tray backward off the shelf. He put it on the counter. The West Point ring had rolled over, like a tiny golf ball. Reacher picked it up. It was engraved inside. Which meant it wasn&#x2019;t a replica. Not for a fianc�e or a girlfriend. Replicas were never engraved. An old tradition. No one knew why.<br><br>Not a tribute, not a souvenir. It was the real deal. A cadet&#x2019;s own ring, earned over four hard years. Worn with pride. Obviously. If you weren&#x2019;t proud of the place, you didn&#x2019;t buy a ring. It wasn&#x2019;t compulsory.<br><br>The engraving said S.R.S. 2005.<br><br>The bus blew its horn three times. It was ready to go, but it was a passenger short. Reacher put the ring down and said, &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; and walked out of the store. He hustled back past the restroom block and leaned in the door of the bus and said to the driver, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m staying here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No refunds.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not looking for one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You got a bag in the hold?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No bag.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have a nice day.&#x201d;<br><br>The guy pulled a lever and the door sucked shut in Reacher&#x2019;s face. The engine roared and the bus moved off without him. He turned away from the diesel smoke and walked back toward the pawn shop.<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>The guy in the pawn shop was a little disgruntled to have to get the ring tray out again so soon after he had put it away. But he did, and he placed it in the same spot on the counter. The West Point ring had rolled over again. Reacher picked it up.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;Do you remember the woman who pawned this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How would I?&#x201d; the guy said. &#x201c;I got a million things in here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You got records?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You a cop?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Reacher said.<br><br>&#x201c;Everything in here is legal.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care. All I want is the name of the woman who brought you this ring.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We went to the same school.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where is that? Upstate?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;East of here,&#x201d; Reacher said.<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be a classmate. Not from 2005. No offense.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;None taken. I was from an earlier generation. But the place doesn&#x2019;t change much. Which means I know how hard she worked for this ring. So now I&#x2019;m wondering what kind of unlucky circumstance made her give it up.&#x201d;<br><br>The guy said, &#x201c;What kind of a school was it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They teach you practical things.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Like a trade school?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;More or less.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe she died in an accident.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe she did,&#x201d; Reacher said. Or not in an accident, he thought. There had been Iraq, and there had been Afghanistan: 2005 had been a tough year to graduate. He said, &#x201c;But I would like to know for sure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; the guy said again.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you exactly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is it an honor thing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I guess it could be.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Trade schools have that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some of them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There was no woman. I bought that ring. With a lot of other stuff.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;About a month ago.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;From who?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to tell you my business. Why should I? It&#x2019;s all legal. It&#x2019;s all perfectly legitimate. The state says so. I have a license and I pass all kinds of inspections.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then why be shy about it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s private information.&#x201d;<br><br>Reacher said, &#x201c;Suppose I buy the ring?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s fifty bucks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thirty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Forty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Deal,&#x201d; Reacher said. &#x201c;So now I&#x2019;m entitled to know its provenance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This ain&#x2019;t Sotheby&#x2019;s auction house.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Even so.&#x201d;<br><br>The guy paused a beat.<br><br>Then he said, &#x201c;It was from a guy who helps out with a charity. People donate things and take the deduction. Mostly old cars and boats. But other things, too. The guy gives them an inflated receipt for their tax returns, and then he sells the things he gets wherever he can, for whatever he can, and then he cuts a check to the charity. I buy the small stuff from him. I get what I get, and I hope to turn a profit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So you think someone donated this ring to a charity and took a deduction on their income taxes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Makes sense, if the original person died. From 2005. Part of the estate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; Reacher said. &#x201c;I think a relative would have kept it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Depends if the relative was eating well.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You got tough times here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m OK. But I own the pawn shop.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yet people still donate to good causes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In exchange for phony receipts. In the end the government eats the tax relief. Welfare by another name.&#x201d;<br><br>Reacher said, &#x201c;Who is the charity guy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t tell you that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s none of your business. I mean, who the hell are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just a guy already having a pretty bad day. Not your fault, of course, but if asked to offer advice I would have to say it might prove a dumb idea to make my day worse. You might be the straw that breaks the camel&#x2019;s back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You threatening me now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;More like the weather report. A public service.

Here Ozment, the leading historian of the family in the middle centuries, replaces the often miserable depiction of premodern family relations with a delicately nuanced portrait of a vibrant and loving social group. Mining the records of families' private lives--from diaries and letters to fiction and woodcuts--Ozment shows us a preindustrial family not very different from the later family of high industry that is generally viewed as the precursor to the sentimental nuclear family of today. </p><p>In <i>Ancestors</i>, we see the familiar pattern of a domestic wife and working father in a home in which spousal and parental love were amply present: parents cherished their children, wives were helpmeets in providing for the family, and the genders were nearly equal. Contrary to the abstractions of history, parents then--as now--were sensitive to the emotional and psychological needs of their children, treated them with affection, and gave them a secure early life and caring preparation for adulthood. </p><p>As it recasts familial history, <i>Ancestors</i> resonates beyond its time, revealing how much the story of the premodern family has to say to a modern society that finds itself in the throes of a family crisis.</p></p><p>Steven Ozment is McLean Professor of Ancient and Modern History at Harvard University. He is the author of Flesh and Spirit and The B�rgermeister&#x2019;s Daughter.&#x201c;<b>Ozment</b>...has written a concise answer to [Philippe] Ari�s and his admirers which can be read in a pleasurable couple of hours by the occupant of a Saturday sofa or a seat on a commuter train. In <i>Ancestors</i>...Ozment sets out to challenge a conception of the premodern family as a stifling patriarchal tyranny inimical to &#x2018;bonds of deep affection or relationships of true equality&#x2019;... Everybody interested in the history of the family should certainly read this thought-provoking little book, tract for the times as well as guide to the past.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ralph Houlbrooke</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In the 1960s and 1970s a group of enormously influential historians...argued that pre-industrial families were...rigidly &#x2018;patriarchal,&#x2019; and children were viewed mainly as assets; hence the deep bonds of love and care between parent and child which we now associate with the &#x2018;nuclear family&#x2019; were essentially nonexistent. In this elegant, persuasive book...<b>Ozment</b> presents a very different picture. He argues that the relationship between spouses was far more cooperative and loving, and the affection of parents for their children was far fiercer, than [Philippe] Ari�s and his disciples would have it... An example of scholarship confirming common sense (and refuting the highly theoretical work of once trendy historians)... <i>Ancestors</i> amounts to an eloquent&#x2015;and academically unfashionable&#x2015;condemnation of those historians who approach an earlier age &#x2018;with an eye only to determining where that age stands on some burning present-day issue.&#x2019;&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Benjamin Schwarz</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Atlantic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Steven Ozment</b>&#x2019;s handsome short book Ancestors is an unashamed polemic, a robust if not uniformly persuasive defense of the existence of the &#x2018;loving family in Old Europe,&#x2019; and an assertion of its fundamental continuity with modern family experience... Ozment is...a first-rate religious historian.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Eamon Duffy</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;For some years now, says <b>Steven Ozment</b>...historians have been...maintaining that all the virtues we associate with families today&#x2015;love, cooperation, mutual respect, the nurturing of children&#x2015;are modern inventions, unknown in Europe prior to the Renaissance. Any evidence to the contrary [has been] dismissed as an exception to the rule. But how &#x2018;exceptional&#x2019; can it be, Ozment asks, if sources ranging from the arts to legal records to advice books to private letters and diaries, from the days of the Roman Empire to the modern era, all attest not to a Dark Ages of the emotions but to an emotional life much like our own? From sources such as these he marshals ample proof that men and women throughout history have married for love, have raised their children with tender affection and sent them out into the world with a mixture of pride and trepidation, and that women&#x2019;s work both inside and outside the home has been acknowledged and valued. Ozment speaks to a general audience, not just a scholarly one, when he warns us about the temptation to believe &#x2018;that past, present, and future constitute absolutely different periods of time and fundamentally distinct types of humanity.&#x2019; How refreshing it is to find a scholar of Ozment&#x2019;s stature speaking up for such homely notions as common sense and the persistence of human nature.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Ozment</b>...has researched diaries, letters, fiction, and even woodcuts to present a picture of pre-industrial family life in Europe in the Middle Ages. He discusses such themes as working women...and women&#x2019;s place in religion and society. He examines the practice of contraception (condemned by the church and justified by the laity), parent&#x2013;child relations, infanticide, wet-nursing, and parental advice to children... Ozment&#x2019;s absorbing look at some of our ancestors living in a wholly different society shows us how little things have changed.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>George Cohen</b><b>, </b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Ozment</b> argues persuasively that...the family has not evolved slowly over the last five centuries into the sentimental, nuclear unit it appears to be today; rather, it has always been both the bedrock and the fault line of humankind. A groundbreaking work: The hammer of Ozment&#x2019;s silvery prose and sturdy logic shatters the surprisingly fragile theories of some of the trendiest historians of the human family.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A major contribution to a field of historical study that has been particularly active over the last forty years.

Did you know that black history in California precedes Gold Rush history by some 300 years?Did you know that in California during the Gold Rush, blacks created one of the wealthiest, most culturally advanced, most politically active communities in the nation?Few people are aware of the intriguing, dynamic often wholly inspirational stories of African American argonauts, from backgrounds as diverse as those of their less sturdy- complexioned peers. Defying strict California fugitive slave laws and an unforgiving court testimony ban in a state that declared itself free, black men and women combined skill, ambition and courage and rose to meet that daunting challenge with dignity, determination and even a certain �lan, leaving behind a legacy that has gone starkly under-reported.Mainstream history tends to contribute to the illusion that African Americans were all but absent from the California Gold Rush experience.

Stepfathers, by contrast, seemed negligible, if not completely innocuous.<br><br>&#x201c;Squire Allworthy, do you think?&#x201d; he said to his brother. &#x201c;Or Claudius?&#x201d;<br><br>Hal stood restlessly twirling the club&#x2019;s terrestrial globe, looking elegant, urbane, and thoroughly indigestible. He left off performing this activity, and gave Grey a look of incomprehension.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stepfathers,&#x201d; Grey explained. &#x201c;There seem remarkably few of them among the pages of novels, by contrast to the maternal variety. I merely wondered where Mother&#x2019;s new acquisition might fall, along the spectrum of character.&#x201d;<br><br>Hal&#x2019;s nostrils flared. His own reading tended to be confined to Tacitus and the more detailed Greek and Roman <br><br>histories of military endeavor. The practice of reading novels he regarded as a form of moral weakness; forgivable, and in fact, quite understandable in their mother, who was, after all, a woman. That his younger brother should share in this vice was somewhat less acceptable.<br><br>However, he merely said, &#x201c;Claudius? From Hamlet? Surely not, John, unless you happen to know something about Mother that I do not.&#x201d;<br><br>Grey was reasonably sure that he knew a number of things about their mother that Hal did not, but this was neither the time nor place to mention them.<br><br>&#x201c;Can you think of any other examples? Notable stepfathers of history, perhaps?&#x201d;<br><br>Hal pursed his lips, frowning a bit in thought. Absently, he touched the watch pocket at his waist.<br><br>Grey touched his own watch pocket, where the gold and crystal of his chiming timepiece&#x2014;the twin of Hal&#x2019;s&#x2014;made a reassuring weight.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not late yet.&#x201d;<br><br>Hal gave him a sideways look, not a smile&#x2014;Hal was not in a mood that would permit such an expression&#x2014;but tinged with humor, nonetheless.<br><br>&#x201c;He is at least a soldier.&#x201d;<br><br>In Grey&#x2019;s experience, membership in the brotherhood of the blade did not necessarily impute punctuality&#x2014;their friend Harry Quarry was a colonel and habitually late&#x2014;but he nodded equably. Hal was sufficiently on edge already. Grey didn&#x2019;t want to start a foolish argument that might color the imminent meeting with their mother&#x2019;s intended third husband.<br><br>&#x201c;It could be worse, I suppose,&#x201d; Hal said, returning to his moody examination of the globe. &#x201c;At least he&#x2019;s not a bloody merchant. Or a tradesman.&#x201d; His voice dripped loathing at the thought.<br><br>In fact, General Sir George Stanley was a knight, granted that distinction by reason of service of arms, rather than birth. His family had dealt in trade, though in the reasonably respectable venues of banking and shipping. Benedicta Grey, however, was a duchess. Or had been.<br><br>So far reasonably calm in the face of his mother&#x2019;s impending nuptials, Grey felt a sudden drop of the stomach, a visceral reaction to the realization that his mother would no longer be a Grey, but would become Lady Stanley&#x2014;someone quite foreign. This was, of course, ridiculous. At the same time, he found himself suddenly in greater sympathy with Hal.<br><br>The watch in his pocket began to chime noon. Hal&#x2019;s timepiece sounded no more than half a second later, and the brothers smiled at each other, hands on their pockets, suddenly united.<br><br>The watches were identical, gifts from their father upon the occasion of each son&#x2019;s twelfth birthday. The duke had died the day after Grey&#x2019;s twelfth birthday, endowing this small recognition of manhood with a particular poignancy. Grey drew breath to say something, but the sound of voices came from the corridor.<br><br>&#x201c;There he is.&#x201d; Hal lifted his head, evidently undecided whether to go out to meet Sir George or remain in the library to receive him.<br><br>&#x201c;Saint Joseph,&#x201d; Grey said suddenly. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s another notable stepfather.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Quite,&#x201d; said his brother, with a sidelong glance. &#x201c;And which of us are you suggesting . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>A shadow fell across the Turkey carpet, cast by the form of a bowing servant who stood in the doorway.<br><br>&#x201c;Sir George Stanley, my lord. And party.&#x201d;<br>General Sir George Stanley was a surprise. While Grey had consciously expected neither Claudius nor Saint Joseph, the reality was a trifle . . . rounder than anticipated.<br><br>His mother&#x2019;s first husband had been tall and dashing, by report, while her second, his own father, had been possessed of the same slight stature, fairness, and tidy muscularity which he had bequeathed to both his sons. Sir George rather restored one&#x2019;s faith in the law of averages, Grey thought, amused.<br><br>A bit taller than himself or Hal, and quite stout, the general had a face that was round, cheerful, and rosily guileless beneath a rather shabby wig. His features were nondescript in the extreme, bar a pair of wide brown eyes that gave him an air of pleasant expectation, as though he could think of nothing so delightful as a meeting with the person he addressed.<br><br>He bowed in greeting, but then shook hands firmly with both Greys, leaving Lord John with an impression of warmth and sincerity.<br><br>&#x201c;It is kind of you to invite me to luncheon,&#x201d; he said, smiling from one brother to the other. &#x201c;I cannot say how greatly I appreciate your welcome. I feel most awkward, then, to begin at once with an apology&#x2014;but I am afraid I have imposed upon you by bringing my stepson. He arrived unexpectedly this morning from the country, just as I was setting out. Seeing that you will in some sense be brothers . . . I, er, thought perhaps you would pardon my liberty in bringing him along to be introduced.&#x201d; He laughed, a little awkwardly, and blushed; an odd mannerism in a man of his age and rank, but rather endearing, Grey thought, smiling back despite himself.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Hal said, managing to sound cordial.<br><br>&#x201c;Most certainly,&#x201d; Grey echoed. He was standing closest to Sir George, and now turned to the general&#x2019;s companion, hand extended in greeting, and found himself face to face with a tall, slender, dark-eyed young man.<br><br>&#x201c;My Lord Melton, Lord John,&#x201d; the general was saying, a hand on the young man&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;May I present Mr. Percival Wainwright?&#x201d;<br><br>Hal was a trifle put out; Grey could feel the vibrations of annoyance from his direction&#x2014;Hal hated surprises, particularly those of a social nature&#x2014;but he himself had little attention to spare for his brother&#x2019;s quirks at the moment.<br><br>&#x201c;Your servant, sir,&#x201d; he said, taking Mr. Wainwright&#x2019;s hand, with an odd sense of previous meeting.<br><br>The other felt it, too; Grey could see the faint expression of puzzlement on the young man&#x2019;s face, a faint inturning of fine dark brows, as though wondering where . . .<br><br>Realization struck them simultaneously. His hand tightened involuntarily on the other&#x2019;s, just as Wainwright&#x2019;s grip clutched his.<br><br>&#x201c;Yours, sir,&#x201d; murmured Wainwright, and stepped back with a slight cough. He reached to shake Hal&#x2019;s hand, but glanced briefly back at Grey. His eyes were also brown, but not at all like his stepfather&#x2019;s, Grey thought, the momentary shock of recognition fading.<br><br>They were a soft, vivid brown, like sherry sack, and most expressive. At the moment, they were dancing with mirth at the situation&#x2014;and filled with the same intensely personal interest Grey had seen in them once before, at their first meeting . . . in the library of Lavender House.<br><br>Percy Wainwright had given him his name&#x2014;and his hand&#x2014;upon that occasion, too. But Grey had been an anonymous stranger then, and the encounter had been necessarily brief.<br><br>Hal was expressing polite welcome to the newcomer, though giving him the sort of coolly professional appraisal he would use to sum up an officer new to the regiment.<br><br>Grey thought Wainwright stood up well to such scrutiny; he was well-built, dressed neatly and with taste, clear-skinned and clean-featured, with an attitude that spoke of both humor and imagination. Both traits could be dangerous in an officer, but on a personal level . . .<br><br>Wainwright seemed to be discreetly exercising his own curiosity with regard to Grey, flicking brief glances his way&#x2014;and little wonder. Grey smiled at him, now rather enjoying the surprise of this new &#x201c;brother.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thank you,&#x201d; Wainwright said, as Hal concluded his welcome. He pulled his lingering attention away from Grey, and bowed to Hal. &#x201c;Your Grace is most . . . gracious.&#x201d;<br><br>There was an instant of stricken silence following that last, half-strangled word, spoken as Wainwright realized, a moment too late, what he had said.<br><br>Hal froze, for the briefest instant, before recovering himself and bowing in return.<br><br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; he said, with impeccable politeness. &#x201c;Shall we dine, gentlemen?&#x201d;<br><br>Hal turned at once for the door, not looking back. And just as well, Grey thought, seeing the hasty exchange of gestures and glances between the general and his stepson&#x2014;horrified annoyance from the former, exemplified by rolling of the eyes and a brief clutching of the shabby wig; agonized apology by the latter&#x2014;an apology extended wordlessly to Grey, as Percy Wainwright turned to him with a grimace.<br><br>Grey lifted one shoulder in dismissal. Hal was used to it&#x2014;and it was his own fault, after all.<br><br>&#x201c;We are fortunate in our timing,&#x201d; he said, and smiled at Percy. He touched Wainwright&#x2019;s back, lightly encouraging him toward the door. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Thursday. The Beefsteak&#x2019;s cook does an excellent ragout of beef on Thursdays. With oysters.&#x201d;<br><br>Sir George was wise enough to make no apology for his stepson&#x2019;s gaffe, instead engaging both the Greys in conversation regarding the campaigns of the previous autumn. Percy Wainwright appeared a trifle flustered, but quickly regained his composure, listening with every evidence of absorption.<br><br>&#x201c;You were in Prussia?&#x201d; he asked, hearing Grey&#x2019;s mention of maneuvers near the Oder. &#x201c;But surely the Forty-sixth has been stationed in France recently&#x2014;or am I mistaken?&#x201d;<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Encyclopedia of White Magic</h2><p>An English village witch introduces the traditions and practices of witchcraft, and describes the customs and ceremonies appropriate to festivals throughout the year, from one Samhaine at the end of October through the seasons to the next</p><p></p><h2>1545: Who Sank the Mary Rose?</h2><p>The raising of the _Mary Rose_ in 1982 was a remarkable feat of archaeology and her subsequent preservation and display at Portsmouth a triumph of technical skill and imagination. She is more than a relic, however. She has a story to tell, and her sinking in the Solent in 1545, when under attack by the French, and the reasons for it, have intrigued historians for generations. With the benefit of access to her remains, archaeologists have been able to slowly unravel the mystery of her foundering on a calm summer&#x2019;s day in July 1545.<br><br>This new book by one of the country&#x2019;s leading experts on the _Mary Rose_ contains much that is published for the first time. It has the first full account of the battle in which Henry VIII&#x2019;s warship was sunk, and tells the stories of the English and French admirals. It examines the design and construction of the ship and how she was used, and develops themes begun when he was earlier commissioned by the Mary Rose Trust to write the multi-volume history of the ship. He shows for the first time conclusively that the French fleet arrived unexpectedly to seize the Isle of Wight and Portsmouth a day later than was once believed, that the many bodies found in the wreck reflect her at action stations, and that the ship had had an extra deck added and was therefore more unstable than was previously thought. Finally, the author makes it clear who was responsible for the loss of the _Mary Rose_, after describing what happened onboard, deck by deck, in her last moments afloat.<br><br>The fascinating revelation will intrigue the general reader as well as the historian and archaeologist and the book is set to become the last word on the career of this most famous of ships.</p><p>DR PETER MARSDEN is a professional archaeologist who has excavated numerous Roman, medieval and later sites. He was commissioned to record the Bronze Age (c.1550 BC) boat at Dover, and has excavated the oldest seagoing sailing ship found in northern Europe (of c.150 AD), as well as other Roman and medieval shipwrecks in the River Thames. He is a founder of the Council for Nautical Archaeology that successfully campaigned for a law to protect historic shipwrecks (Protection of Wrecks Act 1973), and in 1986 created the Shipwreck Museum at Hastings in East Sussex.

Throughout this book the poet&#39;s abiding concern for language as a living force is revealed.Octavio Paz (1914-1998) was born in Mexico City. He wrote many volumes of poetry, as well as a prolific body of remarkable works of nonfiction on subjects as varied as poetics, literary and art criticism, politics, culture, and Mexican history. He was awarded the Jerusalem Prize in 1977, the Cervantes Prize in 1981, and the Neustadt Prize in 1982. He received the German Peace Prize for his political work, and finally, the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990.</p><h2>The Sources of Shakespeare&#39;s Plays</h2><p>First published in 1977. <br><br>This book ascertains what sources Shakespeare used for the plots of his plays and discusses the use he made of them; and secondly illustrates how his general reading is woven into the texture of his work. Few Elizabethan dramatists took such pains as Shakespeare in the collection of source-material. Frequently the sources were apparently incompatible, but Shakespeare's ability to combine a chronicle play, one or two prose chronicles, two poems and a pastoral romance without any sense of incongruity, was masterly. The plays are examined in approximately chronological order and Shakespeare's developing skill becomes evident.</p><p></p><h2>Fade Away</h2><p>Myron Bolitar once had a promising career as a sportsman, until an accident forced him to quit.

Living and Active answers these fundamental questions by looking anew at Scripture from the perspective of Christian doctrine. <p>Rather than treating the Bible as a sourcebook for theology, Telford Work uses systematic theology to build a compelling new doctrine of Scripture that allows us to see the Bible at work accomplishing God's purposes in the world. Throughout the book, Work incorporates insights from the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, Anabaptist, and evangelical traditions. He also interacts with patristic theology, historical-critical methods of interpretation, and postmodern thought. As a result, Living and Active is the most relevant and ecumenical statement of Scripture now available.</p></p><p>Work is a teaching pastor at Christian Assembly Foursquare Church in Los Angeles, California, and an adjunct professor at both Westmont College, Santa Barbara, and Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena.<br><br>Richard B.

Kostyal has written a tight, bracing biography of the renowned Antarctic explorer, illustrated with dramatic black-and-white photographs. Sir Ernest Shackleton, a man whose sense of romance and adventure repeatedly drew him from conventional British society to Antarctica (&#34;that lonely, windswept desert of ice and snow at the bottom of the world&#34;), succeeded neither in reaching the South Pole nor traversing the continent, but he exhibited such remarkable valor that, according to the author, his name has become &#34;synonymous with bravery and endurance.&#34; There is more about his expeditions than the man, but Kostyal renders the tale in vivid prose that is enhanced by maps, quotes, a timeline and some remarkable photographs.

The sisters move slowly, deliberately, talking in whispers. It&#x2019;s nine in the evening, and the streets are empty. There isn&#x2019;t a curfew in Lvov as there is in Radom, but the blackout is still in effect, and with the street lamps extinguished, it&#x2019;s nearly impossible to see.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe we didn&#x2019;t bring a flashlight,&#x201d; Bella whispers.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I walked the route earlier today,&#x201d; Anna says. &#x201c;Just stay close, I know where I&#x2019;m going.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bella smiles. Slinking through backstreets in the pale blue light of the moon reminds her of the nights she and Jakob used to tiptoe at two in the morning from their apartments to make love in the park under the chestnut trees.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just here,&#x201d; Anna whispers.<br><br> They climb a small flight of stairs, entering the house through a side door. Inside, it&#x2019;s even darker than it is on the street.<br><br> &#x201c;Stay here for a moment while I light a match,&#x201d; Anna says, rummaging through her handbag.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; Bella says, laughing. All her life it&#x2019;s been <i>she </i>who bosses Anna about, not the other way around. Anna is the baby, the family&#x2019;s sweetheart. But Bella knows that behind the pretty face and quiet fa�ade, her sister is whip smart, capable of anything she sets her mind to.<br><br> Despite being two years younger, Anna was the first to marry. She and her husband, Daniel, live just down the street from Bella and Jakob in Lvov&#x2014;a reality that has softened Bella&#x2019;s pain at leaving her parents behind.&nbsp;The sisters see each other often and talk frequently about how to convince their parents to make the move to Lvov. But in her letters, Gustava insists that she and Henry are getting by on their own in Radom. <i>Your father&#x2019;s dentistry is still bringing a bit of income, </i>she wrote in her last correspondence. <i>He&#x2019;s been treating the Germans. It doesn&#x2019;t make sense for us to move, not yet at least. Just promise to visit when you can, and to write often.</i> <br><br> &#x201c;How on earth did you find this place?&#x201d; Bella asks. She&#x2019;d been given no address, just told to follow. They&#x2019;d snaked through so many narrow back alleys on their way, she&#x2019;d lost her sense of direction.<br><br> &#x201c;Adam found it,&#x201d; Anna says, striking a match over and over without a spark. &#x201c;Through the Underground,&#x201d; she adds. &#x201c;Apparently they&#x2019;ve used it before, as a sort of safe house. It&#x2019;s abandoned, so we shouldn&#x2019;t have any surprise visitors.&#x201d; &nbsp;<br><br>Finally, a match &nbsp;takes, emitting a cloud of sharp-smelling sulphur and an amber halo of light.<br><br> &#x201c;Adam said he left a candle by the faucet,&#x201d; she mutters, shuffling toward the sink, a hand cupped over the flame. Adam had found the rabbi, too, which Bella knew was no easy task. When Lvov fell, the Soviets stripped the city&#x2019;s rabbis of their titles and banned them from practicing; those who were unable to find new jobs went into hiding. Yoffe was the only rabbi Adam could find, he said, who wasn&#x2019;t afraid to officiate a marriage ceremony, under the condition that the wedding take place in secrecy.<br><br> In the match&#x2019;s faint glow, the room begins to take shape. Bella looks around, at the shadow of a kettle resting on a stove top, a bowl of wooden spoons silhouetted on the counter, a blackout curtain hanging in a window over the sink. Whoever lived here left in a hurry, it seems. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s incredibly kind of Adam to do this for us,&#x201d; Bella says, more to herself than to her sister. She&#x2019;d met Adam a year ago, when he leased a room in the Kurcs&#x2019; apartment. Mostly she knew him as Halina&#x2019;s boyfriend, calm and cool and rather quiet&#x2014;oftentimes his voice was barely heard around the dinner table. But since arriving in Lvov, Adam has surprised Bella with his ability to orchestrate the impossible: handcrafting false identification cards for the family. As far as the Russians know, Adam works at an orchard outside the city, harvesting apples&#x2014;but in the Underground, Adam has become a prized counterfeiter. By now, hundreds of Jews have pocketed his IDs, which he produces with such a meticulous hand, Bella would swear they are real. <br>&nbsp;<br> She&#x2019;d asked him once how he was able to make them look so authentic. <br><br>&#x201c;They <i>are </i>authentic.&nbsp; The stamps, at least,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said, explaining how he&#x2019;d discovered that he could remove official government stamps from existing IDs with a peeled, just-boiled egg. &#x201c;I lift the original when the egg is still hot,&#x201d; Adam said, &#x201c;then roll the egg over the new ID. Don&#x2019;t ask<br> why, but it works.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Found it!&#x201d; Darkness envelops them once again as Anna fumbles for another match. A moment later, the candle is lit.<br><br>Bella removes her coat, lays it over the back of a chair.<br><br>&#x201c;Cold &nbsp;in here,&#x201d; &nbsp;Anna whispers. &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; Carrying the candle, she makes her way from the sink to stand beside Bella.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s &nbsp;okay.&#x201d; &nbsp;Bella suppresses a shiver. &#x201c;Is &nbsp;Jakob already here? And&nbsp;Genek? Herta? It&#x2019;s so quiet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s here. Getting settled in the foyer, I imagine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;m not to be married in the kitchen?&#x201d; Bella laughs and then sighs, realizing that for as many times as she&#x2019;d told herself she&#x2019;d marry Jakob anywhere, the idea of wedding him here, in the shadowy, ghostlike home of a family she&#x2019;ll never know, was beginning to make her feel uneasy.<br><br>&#x201c;Please. You&#x2019;ve far too much class for a kitchen wedding.&#x201d; <br><br>Bella smiles. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d be nervous.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your <i>wedding </i>day&#x2014;of course you&#x2019;re nervous!&#x201d;<br><br>The words reverberate through her and Bella goes still. &#x201c;I wish Mother and Father could be here,&#x201d; she says finally, and as she hears herself, her eyes well up with tears. She and Jakob had talked about waiting until the war was over to marry, so they could hold a more traditional ceremony in Radom with their families. But there was no telling when the war would end. They&#x2019;d waited long enough, they decided. The Tatars and the Kurcs had both given their blessings from Radom. They&#x2019;d practically begged Jakob and Bella to marry. Still, Bella hates that her parents can&#x2019;t be with her&#x2014;hates that, despite how happy she is now that she&#x2019;s with Jakob, she&#x2019;s also guilty for it. Is it right, she wonders, to celebrate while her country is at war? While her parents are alone in Radom&#x2014;her parents, who, for all of her life, have given her so much when they had so little? Bella&#x2019;s memory flashes to the day when she and Anna returned home from school to find their father in the living room with a scruffy-looking dog at his feet. The pup was a gift, their father told them, from one of his patients who had&nbsp;fallen on hard times and was unable to pay to have a tooth extracted. Bella and Anna, who had begged for a dog since they were toddlers, had shrieked with joy and rushed to hug their father, who wrapped his arms around them, laughing as the dog nipped playfully at their ankles. <br><br>Anna squeezes her hand. &#x201c;I know,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;I wish they could be here, too. But they want this so badly for you. You mustn&#x2019;t worry about them. Not tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>Bella nods. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just so far from what I imagined,&#x201d; she whispers. <br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Anna says again, her voice soft.<br><br> When they were teenagers, Bella and Anna would lie in bed and talk for hours, spinning stories of their wedding days. At the time, Bella could see it perfectly: the sweet-smelling bouquet of white roses her mother would arrange for her to carry; the smile on her father&#x2019;s face as he lifted her veil to kiss her forehead beneath the chuppah; the thrill of slipping a ring over Jakob&#x2019;s index finger, a symbol of their love that he would carry with him for the remainder of his lifetime. Her wedding, had it been in Radom, would have been far from lavish, this she knows. It would have been simple. Beautiful. What it would <i>not </i>have been was a secret ceremony, held in the cold carcass of an abandoned, blacked-out house 500 kilometers from her parents. But, Bella reminds herself, she&#x2019;d chosen to come to Lvov, after all. She and Jakob had decided together to marry here. Her sister is right; her parents have wanted this for her for years. She should focus on what she has, not what she doesn&#x2019;t&#x2014;on this night, especially.<br><br> &#x201c;No one could have predicted this,&#x201d; Anna adds. &#x201c;But just think,&#x201d; she says, her voice growing more chipper, &#x201c;the next time you see <i>Mama i Tata</i>, you will be a married woman! Hard to believe, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br><br> Bella smiles, willing away her tears. &#x201c;It is, in a way,&#x201d; she whispers, thinking about her father&#x2019;s letter, which had arrived two days ago. In it, Henry described how overjoyed he and Gustava were upon learning of her intent to marry. <i>We love you so much, dear Bella. Your Jakob is a good soul, that boy, with a fine family. We will celebrate, all of us, when we are together again. </i>Rather than show the letter to Jakob right away, Bella had slipped it under her pillow and decided she&#x2019;d let him read it later that evening, once they&#x2019;d returned to their apartment, a married couple.<br><br> Sucking in her stomach, Bella runs her hands along the lace bodice of&nbsp;her dress. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so happy it fits,&#x201d; she says, exhaling. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just as beautiful as&nbsp;I remember it.&#x201d; <br><br>When Anna became engaged to Daniel, their mother, knowing that they couldn&#x2019;t afford the kind of dress Anna would want from a dressmaker, decided to make a gown herself. She, Bella, and Anna had scoured the pages of <i>McCall&#x2019;s </i>and <i>Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar </i>for the designs they liked. When Anna finally picked her favorite&#x2014;inspired by film stills of Barbara Stanwyck&#x2014;the Tatar women spent an entire afternoon at Nechuma&#x2019;s fabric shop, poring over bolts of various satins, silks, and laces, marveling over how luxurious each felt as they rubbed it between their fingers. Nechuma gave them the materials they finally selected at cost, and it took Gustava nearly a month to finish the gown&#x2014;a V-neck, with a white lace-trimmed bodice, long gathered Gibson sleeves, buttons down the back, a bell-shaped skirt that fell just to the floor, and a powder-white satin sash gathered at her hips. Delighted, Anna deemed it a <i>masterpiece</i>. Bella had secretly hoped she&#x2019;d get to wear it someday.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just happy I brought it,&#x201d; Anna says. &#x201c;I almost left it with Mother, but I couldn&#x2019;t bear to part with it. Oh, Bella.&#x201d; Anna stands back to take her in. &#x201c;You look so beautiful! Come,&#x201d; she says, adjusting the gold brooch hanging around Bella&#x2019;s neck so it sits perfectly centered in the hollow between her collarbones, &#x201c;before I cry. Are you ready?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Almost.&#x201d; Bella fishes a metal tube from her coat pocket. She removes the lid, then swivels the bottom a half turn and applies a few dabs of Peppercorn Red lipstick carefully to her lips, wishing she had a mirror. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you brought this, too,&#x201d; she says, rubbing her lips together before dropping the tube back into her pocket. &#x201c;And that you were willing to share,&#x201d; she adds. When lipstick was pulled from the market&#x2014;the army had better use for petroleum and castor oil&#x2014;most women they knew clung fiercely to what was left of their supplies.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Anna says. &#x201c;So&#x2014;<i>gotowa?</i>&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Ready.&#x201d;<br><br> Carrying the candle in one hand, Anna guides Bella gently through a doorway.<br><br> The foyer is dimly illuminated by two small votives propped on the staircase balusters. Jakob stands at the foot of the stairs. At first, all Bella&nbsp;can make out of him is his silhouette&#x2014;his narrow torso, the gentle slope of his shoulders. <br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll save this one for later,&#x201d; Anna says, snuffing out her candle. She kisses Bella on the cheek. &#x201c;I love you,&#x201d; she says, beaming, and then makes her way to greet the others. Bella can&#x2019;t see them, but she can hear whispers: <i>Och, jaka pie, kna! Beautiful!</i><br><br>A second silhouette stands motionless beside her groom, the candlelight catching the frizz of a long, silver beard. It must be the rabbi, Bella realizes. She steps into the flickering glow of the votives, and as she slides her elbow through Jakob&#x2019;s, she feels the tightness between her ribs disappear. She isn&#x2019;t nervous anymore, or cold. She&#x2019;s floating.<br><br> Jakob&#x2019;s eyes are wet when they meet hers. In her sister&#x2019;s ivory kitten heels, she&#x2019;s nearly as tall as he. He plants a kiss on her cheek.<br><br> &#x201c;Hello, sunshine,&#x201d; he says, smiling.<br><br> &#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; Bella replies, grinning. One of the onlookers chuckles.<br><br> The rabbi extends a hand. His face is a maze of wrinkles. He must be in his eighties, Bella guesses. &#x201c;I am Rabbi Yoffe,&#x201d; he says. His voice, like his beard, is rough around the edges.<br><br> &#x201c;Pleasure,&#x201d; Bella says, taking his hand and dipping her chin. His fingers feel frail and knotted between hers, like a cluster of twigs. &#x201c;Thank you for this,&#x201d; she says, knowing what a risk he&#x2019;d taken to be there.<br><br> Yoffe clears his throat. &#x201c;Well. Shall we get started?&#x201d; Jakob and Bella nod.<br><br> &#x201c;<i>Yacub</i>,&#x201d; Yoffe begins, &#x201c;repeat after me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jakob does his best not to bungle Rabbi Yoffe&#x2019;s words, but it&#x2019;s difficult, partly because his Hebrew is rudimentary, but mostly because he&#x2019;s too distracted by his bride to keep a thought in his mind for more than a few seconds. She is spectacular in her gown. But it&#x2019;s not the dress he&#x2019;s taken by. He&#x2019;s never seen her skin so smooth, her eyes so bright, her smile, even in the shadows, such a perfect, radiant cupid&#x2019;s bow. Against the ebony backdrop of the abandoned house, ensconced in the golden glimmer of candlelight, she appears angelic. He can&#x2019;t take his eyes off her. And so he stumbles through his prayers, thinking not about his words but about the image of his soon-to-be wife before him, memorizing her every curve, wishing he could snap a photo so he could show her later on just how beautiful she looked. <br>&nbsp;<br> Yoffe pulls a handkerchief from his breast pocket, places it over Bella&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;Walk seven times,&#x201d; he instructs, drawing an imaginary circle on the floor with his index finger &#x201c;around <i>Yacub</i>.&#x201d; Bella extracts her elbow from Jakob&#x2019;s and obeys, her heels clicking softly on the wooden floorboards as she walks a circle, and then two. Each time she passes in front of him, Jakob whispers, &#x201c;You are exquisite.&#x201d; And each time, Bella blushes. When she has returned to Jakob&#x2019;s side, Yoffe offers a short prayer and reaches again into his pocket, this time removing a cloth napkin, folded in two. He opens it, revealing a small light bulb with a broken filament&#x2014;a functioning light is too precious to break now.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, it no longer works,&#x201d; he says, wrapping up the bulb and bending slowly to place it at their feet. Something creaks and Jakob wonders whether it&#x2019;s the floorboards or one of the rabbi&#x2019;s joints. &#x201c;In the midst of this happy occasion,&#x201d; Yoffe says, righting himself, &#x201c;we should not forget how fragile life truly is. The breaking of glass&#x2014;a symbol of the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem, of man&#x2019;s short life on earth.&#x201d; He motions to Jakob, and then to the floor. Jakob brings a foot down gently on the napkin, resisting the urge to stomp for fear that someone might hear.<br><br> &#x201c;Mazel tov!&#x201d; the others cry softly from the shadows, also straining to subdue their cheers. Jakob takes Bella&#x2019;s hands, weaving his fingers between hers.<br><br> &#x201c;Before we finish,&#x201d; Yoffe says, pausing to look from Jakob to Bel...</p></p><h2>Lanie&#39;s Real Adventures (American Girl: Lanie, 2)</h2><p>Lanie is delighted that her aunt has returned and her wild garden is taking off--but her next door neighbor is not happy that Lanie is growing a &#34;weed garden&#34; right in their suburban neighborhood, next to her prize roses.

Spence's meticulous research has, perhaps most notably, uncovered evidence that Austen and the charming young Irishman Tom Lefroy fell in love at the age of twenty and that the relationship inspired Pride and Prejudice, one of the most celebrated works of fiction ever written. Becoming Jane Austen gives the fullest account we have of the romance, which was more serious and more enduring than previously believed. Seeing this love story in the context of Jane Austen's whole life enables us to appreciate the profound effect the relationship had on her art and on subsequent choices that she made in her life.</p><br><br><p>Full of insight and with an attentive eye for detail, Spence explores Jane Austen's emotional attachments and the personal influences that shaped her as a novelist. His elegant narrative provides a point of entry into Jane Austen's world as she herself perceived and experienced it. It is a world familiar to us from her novels, but in Becoming Jane Austen, Austen herself is the heroine.</p></p><p>Jane Austen was a great novelist and one of the central figures of English literature, but she herself lived a quiet and uneventful life, mostly in the two Hampshire villages of Steventon and Chawton. Jon Spence&#x2019;s new biography focuses its attention away from the wider literary and intellectual currents that informed her writing and instead concentrates on the immediate influences on her life and work. <i>Becoming Jane Austen</i> shows how Jane Austen&#x2019;s own personal experiences resonated throughout her work, from her juvenilia to Sanditon.<br>Jon Spence is an American and was educated at King&#39;s College, London University.

His first book, <i>Zim-A Baseball Life</i>, was a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller and one of the best baseball memoirs ever published. Now, in <i>The Zen of Zim</i>, one of baseball's most beloved figures offers readers an insightful look into the baseball of yesterday and today. Baseball fans will love hearing Zim's positions on such things as pitching inside, managing, bosses, and more.<br><br>With more than fifty-six years in baseball, Don Zimmer had seen it all, or so he thought before he ran into George Steinbrenner. Here Zimmer provides a revealing account of his eight years as Joe Torre's right-hand man-and the jealousy, vindictiveness, and pettiness that ultimately destroyed a twenty-five-year friendship with Steinbrenner.<br><br>Zim will also discuss the circumstances that led to his charging onto the field at Fenway Park and throwing a haymaker at Boston Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez. He'll share with readers what it was like to work for other baseball owners; shed new light on general managers like Branch Rickey and Dan Duquette; and critique the managing styles of some of the most famous and notorious skippers of the twentieth century, from Casey Stengel and Earl Weaver to Gene Mauch and Billy Martin.<br> <br>In a chapter called "What Have They Done to My Game?," Zim will offer a crash course in baseball anthropology, describing how the game and its players have changed over the past fifty years and showing how big money and free agency have destroyed clubhouse camaraderie and turned a team sport into a transient game. In contrast, he celebrates his close-knit teammates on the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers team and the lifelong friendships that were made.<br><br>Zim has seen it all, and here readers learn even more of his life and dreams and of baseball through a half century of experience. It is a story jam-packed with laughs and anecdotes, with excitement and comedy.

Scoring six World Championship rings, Zimmer has overcome more than his share of obstacles to remain loyal to himself, the game, his fans, and to fifty-years of fellow teammates, managers, and coaches by way of old-school smarts, versatility, resilience, and a true love of the sport. Now, with scrappy humor, keen insight, and an opinionated bull's-rush honesty, Zimmer delivers a grand-slam memoir of the challenges, regrets, glories, and triumphs that only a world-class act who's been-there-done-that, could tell.<br><br>THIS IS ZIM ON:<br>* The fallout with George Steinbrenner that ended a twenty-five-year personal and <br> professional relationship<br>* His Fenway Park throw-down with Pedro Martinez that made national headlines<br>* His successful eight-year run as Joe Torre's right-hand man<br>* His lifelong friendships with his 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers team<br>* The effect of big-money on team solidarity<br>* His frank opinions of ballplayers-and the game-past and present<br><br>WITH 16 PAGES OF PHOTOGRAPHS<br><br>"Zim's a guy who's been around baseball for a hundred years and he just makes it fun.

With each mission fraught with perilous risks, and each space program touched by tragedy, these parallel tales of adventure and heroism read like a modern-day thriller. Cutting fast between their differing recollections, this book reveals, in a very personal way, the drama of one of the most ambitious contests ever embarked on by man, set against the conflict that once held the world in suspense: the clash between Russian communism and Western democracy.<br><br>Before training to be the USSR's first man on the moon, Leonov became the first man to walk in space. It was a feat that won him a place in history but almost cost him his life. A year later, in 1966, Gemini 8, with David Scott and Neil Armstrong aboard, tumbled out of control across space. Surviving against dramatic odds-a split-second decision by pilot Armstrong saved their lives-they both went on to fly their own lunar missions: Armstrong to command Apollo 11 and become the first man to walk on the moon, and Scott to perform an EVA during the Apollo 9 mission and command the most complex expedition in the history of exploration, Apollo 15. Spending three days on the moon, Scott became the seventh man to walk on its breathtaking surface. <br><br>Marking a new age of USA/USSR cooperation, the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project brought Scott and Leonov together, finally ending the Cold War silence and building a friendship that would last for decades. <br><br>Their courage, passion for exploration, and determination to push themselves to the limit emerge in these memoirs not only through their triumphs but also through their perseverance in times of extraordinary difficulty and danger.<br></p><p>"Dave Scott and Alexei Leonov have each borne the enormous responsibility of commanding spacecraft and of representing their respective countries in the most fascinating and most expensive race in human history. This is their transcendent recounting of that competition."<br>- Neil Armstrong, from the Foreword<br><br>"Leonov and Scott have gone to extra lengths to explain the inexplicable in <i>Two Sides of the Moon</i>. And thank goodness they have. Theirs was a gamble taken voluntarily and eagerly with the single-minded pursuit of earning the assignment and then getting the job done. Sometimes they were first. Often they were best. Always they were colorful. And yet each time they returned, neither man claimed to have come back a changed man who had gone into space and seen the spirit of the universe. They came back from their missions in space having seen the spirit of themselves as even more of the human beings they were before leaving our world of air, land, and water.... Leonov, the artist and Scott, the engineer/dreamer. The two of them-the Cheaters of Death."<br>- Tom Hanks, from the Introduction<br><br>"What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that men set foot on the moon, but that they set eye on the Earth."<br>- Norman Cousins<br>David Scott is one of twelve men to have walked on the moon. He was born at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, educated at West Point, and received his pilot wings in 1955. He earned two graduate degrees at MIT and completed the Air Force Experimental Test Pilot School before being selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1963. He flew three space missions: first as pilot of Gemini 8 in 1966, then as command module pilot on Apollo 9 in 1969, and finally as commander of Apollo 15 in 1971. He was subsequently assigned to the joint USA/USSR Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, and from 1973 to 1977 worked as deputy director and director of the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. He went on to found two private companies, applying his technological expertise in the arena of commercial space, and has also acted as technical adviser on the film Apollo 13 and Tom Hanks's award-winning series From the Earth to the Moon. <br><br>Alexi Leonov was born in Siberia in 1934 and graduated from the Chuguyev Higher Air Force School in the Ukraine in 1957, before serving as a fighter pilot in East Germany in 1959. He was among the first group of cosmonauts selected in 1960 and flew two space missions: first as pilot of Voskhod 2 in 1965 and then in 1975 as commander of Soyuz 19 during the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. In 1966 he was appointed commander of the lunar training group and would have been the first Soviet cosmonaut on the moon. He became deputy director of the Gagarin Cosmonaut Center and was promoted to the rank of major general. He is currently vice president of Russia's Alpha Bank.

She is a public speaker on alternative education for children with autism.An Inch, or Ten Thousand Miles<br><br>November 2001<br><br>JAKE, AGE THREE<br><br>"Mrs. Barnett, I'd like to talk to you about the alphabet cards you've been sending to school with Jacob."<br><br>Jake and I were sitting with his special ed teacher in our living room during her monthly, state-mandated visit to our home. He loved those brightly colored flash cards more than anything in the world, as attached to them as other children were to love-worn teddy bears or threadbare security blankets. The cards were sold at the front of the SuperTarget where I did my shopping. Other children snuck boxes of cereal or candy bars into their mothers' shopping carts, while the only items that ever mysteriously appeared in mine were yet more packs of Jake's favorite alphabet cards.<br><br>"Oh, I don't send the cards; Jake grabs them on his way out the door. I have to pry them out of his hands to get his shirt on. He even takes them to bed with him!"<br><br>Jake's teacher shifted uncomfortably on the couch. "I wonder if you might need to adjust your expectations for Jacob, Mrs. Barnett. Ours is a life skills program. We're focusing on things like helping him learn to get dressed by himself someday." Her voice was gentle, but she was determined to be clear.<br><br>"Oh, of course, I know that. We're working on those skills at home, too. But he just loves his cards . . ."<br><br>"I'm sorry, Mrs. Barnett. What I'm saying is that we don't think you're going to need to worry about the alphabet with Jacob."<br><br>Finally--finally--I understood what my son's teacher had been trying to tell me. She wanted to protect me, to make sure I was clear on the objectives of a life skills program. She wasn't saying that alphabet flash cards were premature. She was saying we wouldn't ever have to worry about the alphabet with Jake, because they didn't think he'd ever read.<br><br>It was a devastating moment, in a year that had been full of them. Jake had recently been diagnosed with autism, and I had finally come to understand that all bets were off as to when (or whether) Jake would reach any of the normal childhood developmental milestones. I had spent nearly a year stepping forward to meet the gaping, gray uncertainty of autism. I had stood by helplessly watching as many of Jake's abilities, such as reading and talking, had disappeared. But I was not going to let anyone slam the door shut on the potential of this child at the tender age of three, whether he was autistic or not.<br><br>Ironically, I wasn't hopeful that Jake would ever read, but neither was I prepared to let anyone set a ceiling for what we could expect from him, especially one so low. That morning, it felt as if Jake's teacher had slammed a door on his future.<br><br>For a parent, it's terrifying to fly against the advice of the professionals, but I knew in my heart that if Jake stayed in special ed, he would slip away. So I decided to trust my instincts and embrace hope instead of abandoning it. I wouldn't spend any time or energy fighting to convince the teachers and therapists at his school to change their expectations or their methods. I didn't want to struggle against the system or impose what I felt was right for Jake on others. Rather than hiring lawyers and experts and advocates to get Jake the services he needed, I would invest directly in Jake and do whatever I felt was necessary to help him reach his full potential--whatever that might be.<br><br>As a result, I made the scariest decision of my life. It meant going against the experts and even my husband, Michael. That day, I resolved to stoke Jake's passion. Maybe he was trying to learn to read with those beloved alphabet cards, maybe he wasn't. Either way, instead of taking them away, I would make sure he had as many as he wanted.<br><br>Three years before, I'd been ecstatic to find out I was pregnant with Jake. At twenty-four, I'd been practicing for the role of mother as far back as I could remember.<br><br>Even as a little girl, it was clear to me (and to everyone around me) that children were likely to hold a special place in my future. My family had always called me the Pied Piper, because wherever I went, there was sure to be a trail of little ones on my heels, waiting for an adventure to begin. My brother, Benjamin, was born when I was eleven, and right from the start he was never far from my hip. By the time I was thirteen, I was the go-to babysitter for the whole neighborhood, and by fourteen I was in charge of the Sunday school at our church. So nobody was the least bit surprised when I went to work as a live-in nanny to help pay my way through college. Then, after I got married, I opened my own daycare, a lifelong dream. I'd been around children my whole life, and now I couldn't wait to have my own.<br><br>Unfortunately, the road leading to Jake's birth was not easy. Although I was still young, the pregnancy was touch and go from the beginning. I developed a dangerous high-blood-pressure condition called preeclampsia, which is common in pregnancy and can harm both mother and child. My mother helped out with my daycare, as I was desperate to hold on to the baby. But the pregnancy became more and more fraught, as I went into preterm labor again and again. Eventually, my doctors became so concerned that they put me on medication and strict bed rest to help prevent premature labor. Even so, I was hospitalized nine times.<br><br>Three weeks before my due date, I was rushed to the hospital once again, this time in labor that couldn't be reversed. A cascade of events made the outcome increasingly uncertain. For me, the scene was a kaleidoscope of people rushing in and out, alarms sounding constantly, as the faces of the nurses and doctors crowding the room grew increasingly tense. Michael says this was the day he saw exactly how tough and stubborn I could be. I didn't know it at the time, but my doctor had pulled him aside to tell him that labor wasn't going well and he needed to be prepared: It was likely he would be going home with either a wife or a baby, but not both.<br><br>All I knew was that in the middle of the hazy blur of noise, pain, medication, and fear, suddenly Michael was by my side, holding my hand and looking into my eyes. He was a tractor beam, pulling my -attention--my whole being--into focus. That moment is the only clear memory I have of that frantic time. I felt as if a camera had zoomed in on us and all the commotion surrounding us had ceased. For me, there was only Michael, fiercely strong and absolutely determined that I hear him.<br><br>"There aren't just two but three lives at stake here, Kris. We're going to get through this together. We have to."<br><br>I don't know whether it was the actual words he said or the look in his eyes, but his urgent message broke through the fog of my terror and pain. He willed me to understand the unending depth of his love for me and to draw strength from it. He seemed so certain that it was in my power to choose life that he made it true. And in a way that felt sacred, he promised in return to be a never-ending source of strength and happiness for me and for our child for the rest of his days. He was like the captain of a ship in a terrible storm, commanding me to focus and to survive. And I did.<br><br>Real or imagined, I also heard him promise me fresh flowers in our home every day for the rest of my life. Michael knew that I had always been wild for flowers, but a bouquet from a florist was a luxury we could afford on only the most special occasions. Nevertheless, the next day, while I held our beautiful baby boy in my arms, Michael presented me with the most beautiful roses I have ever seen in my life. Thirteen years have passed since that day, and fresh flowers have arrived for me every week, no matter what.<br><br>We were the lucky ones--the happy miracle. We couldn't know it then, but this would not be the last time our family would be tested or that we would beat incredible odds. Outside of romance novels perhaps, people don't talk seriously about the kind of love that makes anything possible. But Michael and I have that kind of love. Even when we don't agree, that love is our mooring in rough waters. I know in my heart it was the power of Michael's love that pulled Jake and me through the day Jake was born, and it has made everything that has happened since then possible.<br><br>When we left the hospital, Michael and I had everything we'd ever wanted. I'm sure every new family feels that way, but we truly felt that we were the most fortunate people on the planet.<br><br>On the way home, with our brand-new bundle in tow, we stopped to sign the final mortgage papers on our first home. With a little help from my larger-than-life grandfather Grandpa John Henry, we were moving into a modest house at the end of a cul-de-sac in a working-class suburb in Indiana, where I also would operate my daycare business.<br><br>Glancing over Jake's fuzzy newborn head at a beaming Michael, I was suddenly reminded that it was pure serendipity that Michael and I had found each other--especially when our first meeting seemed so ill-fated.<br><br>Michael and I met while we were in college. Our seeming "chance encounter" was actually the ploy of my meddling sister, Stephanie. Completely unbeknownst to me, she had felt compelled to play matchmaker--a ludicrous notion, since I was emphatically not in the market for a beau. On the contrary, I was on the giddy cusp of becoming officially engaged--I hoped--to a wonderful young man named Rick, my very own Prince Charming. We were blissful together, and I was looking forward to our happily ever after.<br><br>Stephanie, however, had a "feeling" about me and a boy from her public-speaking class--a boy who was not just brilliant but electrifying, a boy she was convinced was my true soul mate. So she hatched a scheme.<br><br>On the afternoon she sprung her trap, I was busy in her powder room, readying myself for a date with Rick, with at least twenty different shades of lipstick and eight pairs of shoes out for consideration. When I finally emerged, I found that the person standing before me was not my boyfriend, but a boy I'd never laid eyes on before. There, in her tiny studio apartment, under false pretenses, Stephanie introduced me to Michael Barnett.<br><br>Confused by this unexpected visitor, I looked to my sister for an explanation. She pulled me aside to confide in a hushed whisper things that made no sense at all. She said that she'd invited this boy over so that we'd be forced to meet. She'd even called my boyfriend with an excuse to cancel our date that evening.<br><br>At first I was too dumbstruck to react. As it slowly dawned on me that Stephanie was trying to play Cupid, I truly thought she'd lost her mind. Who fixes up someone who's hoping her boyfriend is about to propose?<br><br>I was furious. She and I hadn't been raised to play the field. In fact, I hadn't gone on my first date until I was in college. We certainly hadn't been taught to be dishonest or disloyal either. What could she have been thinking? But as much as I felt like screaming at her--or storming out of the apartment altogether--we'd been raised with good manners, and Stephanie was counting on that.<br><br>I extended my hand to the boy, who was as much a pawn in Stephanie's charade as I, and took a seat with him and my sister in the living room. Stilted chatter ensued, although I wasn't really paying attention. When I finally looked at the boy, really registering him for the first time, I noticed his backward baseball cap, his bright eyes, and his ridiculous goatee. With his laid-back, scruffy appearance, I assumed that he lacked substance. The contrast with my crisply formal, preppy boyfriend could not have been more pronounced.<br><br>Why had Stephanie wanted us to meet? I was a country girl, from a family that for generations had lived a modest, simple life. Rick had shown me a very different world--one that included penthouses, car services, ski vacations, nice restaurants, and art gallery openings. Not that any of that mattered. Stephanie could have brought Brad Pitt into the living room, and I still would have been angry at her for disrespecting my relationship. But the contrast between this disheveled college student and the shiny penny I was seeing made me wonder all the more what my sister had been thinking.<br><br>Before long, Stephanie yanked me from my silent perch and, trying to find a bit of privacy within her tiny studio apartment, chided me sternly. "Where are your manners?" she demanded. "Yell at me later if you like, but give this boy the courtesy of a proper conversation." She was, I saw immediately and with embarrassment, right. Being rude to a stranger--a guest!--was unacceptable. Courtesy and graciousness were qualities that had been instilled in us since birth by our parents, our grandparents, and the tight-knit community in which we'd been raised, and so far I had been as cold as ice.<br><br>Shamefaced, I went back to sit down and made my apologies to Michael. I told him that I was in a relationship and didn't know what Stephanie could possibly have been thinking when she'd arranged this meeting. Of course, I explained, I wasn't angry with him--only at my sister for putting the two of us in this ridiculous situation. With that out in the open, we laughed at the utter preposterousness of it and marveled at Stephanie's audacity. The tension in the room eased considerably, and the three of us fell into easy conversation. Michael told me about his classes and about an idea he had for a screenplay.<br><br>That's when I saw what Stephanie wanted me to see. The passion and drive that animated Michael when he spoke about his screenplay were unlike anything I'd seen in anyone I'd ever met. He sounded like me! I felt my stomach lurch and experienced a kind of vertigo. Instantly, I knew that my future, so certain only moments before, would not go according to plan. I would not be marrying my boyfriend. Although he was a wonderful man, that relationship was over. I had no choice in the matter. I'd known Michael Barnett for less than an hour, and yet with a certainty impossible to explain or defend, I already knew that I would be spending the rest of my life with him.</p><h2>Land of Promise: An Economic History of the United States</h2><p><p>A sweeping and original work of economic history by Michael Lind, one of America&#x2019;s leading intellectuals, <em>Land of Promise </em>recounts the epic story of America&#x2019;s rise to become the world&#x2019;s dominant economy.

Building upon the strength and lucidity of his <em>New York Times </em>Notable Books <em>The Next American Nation </em>and <em>Hamilton&#x2019;s Republic</em>, Lind delivers a necessary and revelatory examination of the roots of American prosperity&#x2014;insight that will prove invaluable to anyone interested in exploring how we can move forward.</p></p><p><p>From one of America&#x2019;s leading intellectuals comes a sweeping and original work of economic history, recounting the epic story of America&#x2019;s rise to become the world&#x2019;s dominant economy.</p><p>In <em>Land of Promise</em>, bestselling author Michael Lind provides a groundbreaking account of how a weak collection of former British colonies became an industrial, financial, and military colossus. From the eighteenth to the twenty-first centuries, the American economy has been transformed by wave after wave of emerging technology: the steam engine, electricity, the internal combustion engine, computer technology. Yet technology-driven change leads to growing misalignment between an innovative economy and anachronistic legal and political structures until the gap is closed by the modernization of America's institutions&#x2014;often amid upheavals such as the Civil War and Reconstruction and the Great Depression and World War II.</p><p>Against the dramatic backdrop of shattering tides of change, <em>Land of Promise</em> portrays the struggles and achievements of inventors like Thomas Edison and Samuel Morse; entrepreneurs like Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs; financiers like J. P. Morgan; visionary political leaders like Henry Clay and Franklin Roosevelt; and dynamic policy makers like Alexander Hamilton and Vannevar Bush. Larger-than-life figures such as these share the stage with the ordinary Americans who built a superpower, from midwestern farmers, southern slaves, and the immigrants who created canals and railroads to the sisters of Rosie the Riveter, whose labor in factories during World War II helped to end Hitler's dream of world domination.</p><p>When the U.S. economy has flourished, Lind argues, government and business, labor and universities, have worked together as partners in a never-ending project of economic nation building. As the United States struggles to emerge from the Great Recession, <em>Land of Promise</em> demonstrates that Americans, since the earliest days of the republic, have reinvented the American economy&#x2014;and have the power to do so again.</p><p>Michael Lind is cofounder of the New America Foundation and policy director of its Economic Growth Program. His first three books of political journalism and history&#x2014;<em>The Next American Nation</em>, <em>Up from Conservatism</em>, and <em>Vietnam: The Necessary War</em>&#x2014;were all <em>New York Times</em> Notable Books.

This awkwardly titled seminar was designed to acquaint teachers and parents with basic information about motivation, the impact of learning problems on motivation, and strategies to improve a student's efforts in the classroom and at home.</p><p>I was delivering the seminar to the faculty of a small Midwestern high school during a staff development day. Among the audience members was a stern-looking middle-aged gentleman who -- I later learned -- taught United States history and civics. He sat tight-lipped with his arms crossed firmly throughout the seminar. Although we never spoke to each other during the workshop, his body language clearly communicated that he was not buying what I was selling. He rolled his eyes and sighed audibly several times during my presentation. He shifted impatiently in his seat and glanced at his watch repeatedly. His behavior demonstrated that he had not begged his supervisor to allow him to attend a motivation workshop that day.</p><p>At the conclusion of the seminar, I opened the floor to questions. I was disheartened -- but not surprised -- to see this gentleman's hand shoot up. I acknowledged him and he stood and stared icily at me. "Your workshop had a lot of suggestions and plenty of reasons why kids aren't motivated to learn, but I am in total disagreement with your premise."</p><p>"And what is the source of our disagreement?" I asked, tentatively.</p><p>"Quite simply, <i>it's not my job to motivate these kids</i>. If they come to my class and they want to sit quietly and learn history, I will gladly give them the facts, information, and concepts that they need. If they are not motivated to learn, they can sit in the back of the class and sleep if they wish. It's their choice. It's their loss. I communicate information...and I do that very well. But if a kid doesn't care to learn it, that is not my problem. It's <i>his</i> problem. I'm a teacher, not a cheerleader."</p><p>We discussed...and argued...and debated...and dickered...and quarreled.</p><p>Because we disagreed so fundamentally on this issue, the discussion became quite heated. Finally, I said in some frustration, "But there are many legitimate reasons why a student can lack motivation: fear of failure, lack of understanding, learning disorders, frustration. Every learning theorist from Piaget to Gardner has stated that the learning process begins with motivation. Without motivation, there is no learning. Attempting to teach a child who is unmotivated is as futile as hammering on cold steel."</p><p>"But it's not my job!" he countered.</p><p>"It <i>is</i> your job, sir. Quite simply, kids don't come <i>with batteries included</i>. You've got to provide the batteries if you want them to function."</p><p>I don't believe that I was successful in changing the gentleman's mind, but our exchange <i>did</i> give me a better title for the seminar. I renamed the workshop "Batteries Not Included: Motivating the Struggling Learner," and have delivered programs throughout North America, Australia, Hong Kong, and New Zealand.</p><p>Most teachers and parents recognize that motivation is the key to learning. Reflect for a moment on your favorite teacher in high school. The chances are that he was an effective motivator. He inspired you. He was not merely a teacher, he was also a leader.</p><p>He did not necessarily make learning fun, but he made learning attainable and purposeful. Whether you serve children as a teacher, parent, coach, or instructor, you will multiply your effectiveness immeasurably if you learn how to motivate your charges and maintain that motivation throughout the learning process.</p><p>I began my study of student motivation in the twentieth year of my education career. I interviewed dozens of teachers about student motivation and was surprised and disheartened to find how little my colleagues knew about this important topic. The more I learned about this subject, the more I came to realize that I, also, did not have an effective repertoire of motivational techniques. I tended to use a "one size fits all" approach with my students wherein I expected all of the children to be motivated by the same star chart, checklist, or reward system. This broad approach left many children unmotivated and uninspired. I was able to motivate many of my students. I analyzed the approaches and strategies that were successful with these children. My successes, I came to recognize, were almost accidental -- nearly serendipitous. I made no conscious attempt to match the child to the motivational technique. I merely had the good fortune to use a motivational strategy that, by happenstance, seemed to inspire a particular child.</p><p>After observing one of my classes a generous superior once commented that I was "a natural motivator." I wasn't, and now that I have a better understanding of the intricacies of this complex process we call "motivation," I realize a truly "natural motivator" is a rare, rare person indeed. In order to establish and maintain the motivation of a fellow human being, or a classroom filled with fellow human beings, one must understand the complexities inherent in this elaborate motivation process.</p><p>It is important that adults learn what motivation is! But it is equally important that they <i>unlearn</i> what motivation is not! I have yet to find an undergraduate- or graduate-level curriculum that effectively addresses this fundamental concept. Teachers' lack of training and exposure to the basic tenets of childhood motivation results in a corps of American teachers who are unable to understand or implement effective motivational techniques.</p><p>The media bombards us incessantly with the bad news emanating from America's classrooms. Test scores are down, dropout rates are up, and school violence is on the rise while school attendance declines. Students' high-risk behaviors (drug use, sexual activity, delinquency) increase while SAT scores plummet in some communities. There are innumerable reasons for these statistics, many of which are beyond the control of parents and school personnel. But student motivation is clearly a factor in these upsetting educational trends. This fact should serve as a clarion call to America's parents and professionals to focus time, energy, and other resources on the study and exploration of motivation.</p><p>This book is designed to explore and, to a degree, demystify the complex process of motivating school-aged children. First, we will explore and explode some of the most common myths and misconceptions that impact our understanding of motivation. Following this <i>unlearning</i>, the processes of <i>learning</i> and <i>relearning</i> can begin. Second, we will discuss and demonstrate the significant impact that learning disorders can have upon a student's ability to maintain his motivation in the classroom, at home, and on the playing field.</p><p>The final, and perhaps primary, focus of the book will be a collection of field-tested strategies designed to create, foster, and maintain the motivation of children in a variety of settings.</p><p>It is not overstating the case to say that our nation's future depends greatly on our ability to motivate our children today. This fact should inspire all adults to become more effective motivators. In the sage words of Charles Kettering, "My interest is in the future because I am going to spend the rest of my life there."</p><p>Myths and Misconceptions About Student Motivation</p><p></p><blockquote>"Do something. If it works, do more of it. If it doesn't...do something else." -- Franklin Delano Roosevelt</blockquote> <p>Today's teachers and parents should heed FDR's sage advice. Often, we continue to repeatedly use traditional "motivational techniques" despite the obvious fact that these strategies are not working effectively. I recall a simmering teacher bringing an errant and unmotivated student into my office and complaining, "I have kept Josh in for recess <i>fifteen days in a row</i> and he <i>still</i> isn't doing his math homework."</p><p>Well, let's circle the slow learner in this picture. The strategy is not working. Try something else!</p><p>Because we are unable to inspire our students by igniting their intrinsic (internal) motivation, we try to motivate them extrinsically by establishing a complex tapestry of tests, quizzes, evaluations, and grades. In effect, we <i>force</i> them to be motivated to master the targeted curriculum. ("I know that you will never need to use these algebra equations in real life, Tucker, but you <i>must</i> learn them because they will be on Friday's test.") This unrelenting coercion seems to be a rather unfair use of our power over children. We can do better.</p><p>I have come to recognize that most teachers and parents adhere to a false and shaky set of beliefs related to motivation. These misconceptions must be shelved before we can embrace a more enlightened motivational approach.<i></i></p><p><i><b>Motivation Myth #1</b></i></p><p><i>"That Danny...NOTHING motivates that kid."</i></p><p>Any teacher or parent who makes this statement is displaying a sad lack of knowledge about the true nature of student motivation.</p><p>We must come to understand the most basic tenet of human motivation. This concept is the keystone upon which the remaining pages of this book rest. The simple but profound concept is the following: <i>All human behavior is motivated!</i></p><p>EVERY behavior that we manifest on any given day is motivated. If a reader decides to stop reading this book at this point, I cannot state that the person is "not motivated." She was motivated to <i>stop reading</i>.

In line with the other classics the Author in the present Book has in great detail explained the significance of the Letters in the context of the Tantra knowledge.Thus it becomes a must for the student of Tantra Vidya.</p><p>Born on December 15th, 1865,Sir John Woodroffe graduated in jurisprudence and the Bachelor of Civil Law examinations at Oxford/U.K.. In 1890, He moved to India and enrolled as an advocate in Calcutta High Court. He was soon made a Fellow of the Calcutta University and appointed Law Professor there.He was appointed Standing Counsel to the Government of India in 1902 and two years later was raised to the High Court Bench.After serving for eighteen years in the bench, he became Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court in 1915.After retiring to England he became Reader in Indian Law at the University of Oxford, and finally moved to France in his retirement, where he died in 1936. Alongside his judicial duties he studied Sanskrit and Hindu philosophy and was especially interested in the esoteric Hindu Tantric Shakti system. He translated some twenty original Sanskrit texts, and under his pseudonym Arthur Avalon.He published and lectured prolifically and authoritatively on Indian philosophy and a wide range of Yoga and Tantra topics. His most popular and influential book, a major contribution to the appreciation of Indian philosophy and spirituality, is The Serpent Power The Secrets of Tantric and Shaktic Yoga (a best seller at amazon.com),which is the source of many modern Western appropriations of Kundalini practice. Other writings (published under his own name, as well as Arthur Avalon include: Shakti and Shakta Principles of Tantra (2 vols) Introduction to the Tantra ãstra The Great Liberation Hymns to the Goddess and Hymn to Kali The World as Power All these books are listed on amazon.comSir John woodroffe (Arthur Avalon) was instrumental in removing many of the cobwebs of ignorance that had come to cluster round the Sakta philosophy and practice. The decent Indian mind that had developed a deep-seated prejudice against the Tantras became awake to their excellence after the pioneering work of the great foreigner.By editing the original Sanskrit texts,as also by publsishing essays on the different aspects of Saktism,he showed that this cult had aprofound philosophy behind it,and that there was nothing irrational or obscuranist about the technique of worship it recommends. --Prof.T.M.P.Mahadevan</p><h2>PYTHON ISLE (Doc Savage)</h2><p>1st Bantam 1991 edition paperback. fine condition.

But you better be right about the snow.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>I smoothed my T-shirt and karate pants as I strolled the length of my narrow, window-lined flat. I swung the door open and Dale bolted inside with his mongrel dog, Queen Elizabeth II, at his heels. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We got a snow mission. I&#x2019;ll be ready in three shakes.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry about the gardenia,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to knock, and wake up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. anybody.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p><i>Anybody</i> would be Miss Lana, who wakes up slow.

I&#x2019;m sweltering to death,&#x201d; Dale said. &#x201c;Mama made me layover.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean <i>layer</i>,&#x201d; I said, sliding my jeans over my karate pants.&nbsp;</p><p>Dale, a co-founder of the Desperado Detective Agency, ain&#x2019;t a dead-ahead thinker, but he thinks sideways better than anybody I know. &nbsp;</p><p>I pulled on my red sweater and combed my unruly hair. I opened my filing cabinet, shoved aside unanswered Desperado Detective Agency letters, and snagged my orange socks.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Get gloves too,&#x201d; Dale instructed as someone swished across the living room.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Morning, Miss Lana,&#x201d; I called. &#x201c;Dale and Queen Elizabeth are here. Can I borrow some gloves? It&#x2019;s going to snow.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Snow? Really?&#x201d; she said, peeking in. Miss Lana, a former child star of the Charleston community theater and a fan of Old Hollywood, gave me a wide, sleepy smile&#x2014;the real one, not the one she keeps in her pocket for pain-in-the-neck customers at the caf�. &#x201c;I love snow!&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>She leaned against my doorframe, her <i>Gone with the Wind</i> bed jacket over her pink nightgown, her short coppery hair glistening in the lamplight.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Miss Lana,&#x201d; Dale said, whipping his mama&#x2019;s flowered scarf off his head. &#x201c;I hope you slept good.

I zipped to the curvy white chest of drawers. Her top drawer erupted in elastic and lace.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>All</i> her drawers are odds-and-ends drawers,&#x201d; I muttered, opening them one by one and plucking a pair of blue driving gloves from the bottom drawer.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Mo!&#x201d; Miss Lana shrieked from the kitchen. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t open my bottom drawer!&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Too late,&#x201d; I shouted as a note drifted to the floor. <i>For Mo When She&#x2019;s Ready</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Ready for what?&#x201d; I murmured, uncovering a large white box. I touched a sticky spot where the note used to be as Miss Lana skidded through the door. The Colonel eased in behind her, his bottle-brush gray hair dented on one side, the plaid robe I gave him in first grade cinched at his thin waist.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s in here?&#x201d; I asked, hoisting the box. &#x201c;Can I open it? I feel ready.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Miss Lana said, grabbing it. She looked at the Colonel and gave him a soft nod. He nodded back. &#x201c;Tonight, sugar. When we have time to talk,&#x201d; she said, her voice going tinny.&nbsp;</p><p>Weird. Miss Lana&#x2019;s a theater professional. Her voice never goes tinny.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;But it has my name on it <i> now</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s waited almost twelve years,&#x201d; the Colonel said. &#x201c;It can wait until the end of something as rare as a snow day.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p><i>Our snow day!&nbsp;</i></p><p>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; Dale said, pounding for the door.&nbsp;</p><p>We grabbed our bikes and blasted down the blacktop, into tiny Tupelo Landing.

What these authors have accomplished in their book is precisely what I work to achieve in my courses: to involve students in the learning process by emphasizing the questions rather than just sterile concepts or facts." --Martha Groom, North Carolina State University<br><br>"This continues to be a really exciting project; having now read all the chapters of the book, I am convinced it will provide an innovative and important new direction for ecology teaching."--Andy Dobson, Princeton University<br><br>"I like the approach very much. It is unconventional to begin with a discussion of the history of nature and the history of ecology. These topics are nicely combined and give the students an interesting and sound basis to explore the subject. I like to begin with the largest picture and then work in details and this book takes that approach. I like the style. It is student-friendly, chatty but not popular."--Frank Golley, The University of Georgia<br><br>"Finally!

Great for my community college students!"--Sandra Mitchell, Western Wyoming College<br><br>"Dodson et al. is a striking example of an elegant introductory ecology textbook. The authors intended to focus on questions ecologists ask, rather than on questions ecologists have already answered. To do this, they have pared all of ecology down into eight concise chapters, including the frequently overlooked subject of landscape ecology. . . . The layout is crisp and clear, all chapters are tightly edited to flow in a consistent style, and throughout there is a strong emphasis on concepts and questions. The supporting materials are also excellent, especially the cross-indexed list of references. The index is also quite good."--Ecology</p><h2>Darktown: A Novel (The Darktown Series)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;One incendiary image ignites the next in this highly combustible procedural...written with a ferocious passion that&#x2019;ll knock the wind out of you.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The</i> <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> <br> <b>&#x201c;Fine Southern storytelling meets hard-boiled crime in a tale that connects an overlooked chapter of history to our own continuing struggles with race today.&#x201d; &#x2014;Charles Frazier, bestselling author of <i>Cold Mountain</i></b><br> <br> <b>&#x201c;This page-turner reads like the best of James Ellroy.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review</b><br> <br> <b>&#x201c;In the way the story is told coupled with its heightened racial context, <i>Darktown </i>reminded me of Walter Mosley or a George Pelecanos novel.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</i></b><br> <br> <b>&#x201c;High-quality...crime fiction with a nimble sense of history...quick on its feet and vividly drawn.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Dallas Morning News</i></b><br> <br> <b>&#x201c;Some books educate, some books entertain, Thomas Mullen&#x2019;s <i>Darktown </i>is the rare book that does both.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Huffington Post</i></b><br> <br> The award-winning author of <i>The Last Town on Earth</i> delivers a riveting and elegant police procedural set in 1948 Atlanta, exploring a murder, corrupt police, and strained race relations that feels ripped from today's headlines.<br><br>Responding to orders from on high, the Atlanta Police Department is forced to hire its first black officers, including war veterans Lucius Boggs and Tommy Smith.

Shards of a white Buick&#x2019;s headlight fell scattered across the sidewalk below the now-leaning pole.<br> <br>Locusts continued their thrum in the thick July air. Windows were open throughout town, the impact no doubt waking many. The lone pedestrian on that block, an old man on his way home from sweeping floors at a sugar factory, was no more than ten yards away. He had stepped back when the car jumped the curb but now he stopped and watched for a moment, in case the pole should come crashing the rest of the way down. It didn&#x2019;t. At least not yet.<br> <br>The Buick reversed, slowly, the front wheel easing off the curb. The movement caused the pole to lean the other way, too far, and then back again, a giant metronome.<br> <br>The pedestrian could hear a woman&#x2019;s voice, shouting. Something about what on earth do you think you&#x2019;re doing, just take me home, that sort of thing. The pedestrian shook his head and shambled off before something worse might happen.<br> <br>Whether or not the lampposts were new, exactly, was a matter of perspective. It had been a few months now, but considering how many years it had taken the leaders of Atlanta&#x2019;s colored community to convince the mayor to install them, and considering the many, many years in which Negroes had walked down even their busiest and most monied street in darkness, the celestial presence of those lampposts still felt new.<br> <br>None of which was known to the Buick&#x2019;s driver.<br> <br>He had been attempting to turn around in the middle of the otherwise empty street but had misjudged his turning radius, or the width of the road, or general physics. He also perhaps hadn&#x2019;t noticed that two blocks away were two Atlanta police officers.<br> <br><br> <br>Five minutes earlier, Officer Lucius Boggs finally confronted his partner, Tommy Smith, about his limp.<br> <br>&#x201c;You did not hurt yourself playing baseball. Own up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was a hard slide,&#x201d; Smith said.<br> <br>&#x201c;But you told McInnis you were rounding third.&#x201d;<br> <br>At roll call, Smith had assured their sergeant, McInnis, that his knee was fine, just a tweak he&#x2019;d felt in a game he&#x2019;d played with some buddies. You know how those sand lots are, sir, no traction. McInnis had listened to this stone-faced, as if experienced enough at hearing colored flimflam but deciding the truth of this matter was not worth prodding into.<br> <br>&#x201c;I fell out a window,&#x201d; Smith now admitted to Boggs. They were standing on Hilliard Street, three blocks from the Negro YMCA whose basement served as their makeshift precinct. At that hour the sun was long gone but it had left more than enough heat to last until it felt like showing up again. Both officers had sweated through their undershirts, and even their uniforms were damp.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yours?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>Boggs folded his arms and couldn&#x2019;t help smiling. &#x201c;And who was the lady you were impressing with your acrobatics?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was in the middle of entertaining her with my acrobatics, matter of fact. When her man busted into the apartment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you crazy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;d told me he&#x2019;d left her, pulled up stakes for Detroit. She talked about needing some lawyer to do her divorce papers or something.&#x201d;<br> <br>Atlanta police officers were ordered to abide by a strict moral code&#x2014;no drinking, even at home, and no womanizing&#x2014;but that had not entirely sunk in with Tommy Smith. The Negro officers dutifully avoided alcohol, as they knew all too well that a witness could report them and get them suspended, but for Smith the idea of suddenly becoming a chaste man was altogether too much.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to get yourself killed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I do not go after the married ones.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Except for her, and the girl who did that thing with the candied pecans, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s different, she and I went way back.&#x201d;<br> <br>They started walking again.<br> <br>&#x201c;So then what happened?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think? Pulled on my britches and jumped out the window.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What floor did she live on?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Third.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;One of them places with no fire escape. I&#x2019;d say I&#x2019;m walking remarkably well, considering.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened with the husband?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I did not linger around to eavesdrop.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you at least worried?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She struck me as the kind of gal knew how to handle herself and think on her feet.&#x201d;<br> <br>Boggs was the son of a minister, and though he had chosen not to follow in his father&#x2019;s footsteps, the idea of tomcatting across town the way his partner did was utterly foreign to him. His own experience with women had been limited to innocent dates with well-mannered, well-raised young ladies of the Negro intelligentsia, and he was coming off a recent broken engagement to a girl who&#x2019;d finally told him that the stress of knowing her fianc� might be shot or beaten on any given night was too much for her constitution to handle.<br> <br>A squad car approached, the headlights strangely off. Hilliard had neither lampposts nor sidewalks. They stopped talking and stood there, each wondering if they should back up a few steps, or would that look weak.<br> <br>Then the car accelerated, and each of them did indeed take a step back onto the small plot of grass and weeds that served as someone&#x2019;s front yard. The squad car feinted toward them, swerving a bit, then screeched to a stop.<br> <br>They caught glimpses of two white officers whose faces they didn&#x2019;t recognize&#x2014;cops from other beats who just happened to be driving through, apparently.<br> <br>The white cops yelled, &#x201c;Oooh-oooh-oooh!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aaah-aaah-aaah!&#x201d;<br> <br>Monkey sounds and orangutan sounds and maybe some gorilla thrown in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Woo-woo-woo-boogga-boogga!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Watch your asses, niggers!&#x201d;<br> <br>Then the squad car sped off, the white cops laughing hysterically.<br> <br>You couldn&#x2019;t show fear. They acted like it was all a harmless prank, even when they gunned their engines at you when you were crossing the street, even when they nearly grazed against you. More than once Boggs had stood in the road to flag down a squad car, needing assistance for an arrest, when the car had accelerated toward him until he&#x2019;d had to leap out of the way. Laughter in its wake. Surely, if the day came when they actually did run over one of the colored officers, they would insist it was an accident.<br> <br>Neither Boggs nor Smith felt like telling stories anymore as they reached the corner of Auburn, the night silent but for the almost mechanical churn of locusts and the call-and-response of crickets. The marquee over Bailey&#x2019;s Royal Theater was off, as were the lights of the jeweler and tailoring shops; someone had left on a third-floor office lamp at Atlanta Life Insurance Company, but other than that and the streetlights, all was dark. Then they heard the crash.<br> <br>They turned, each half-hoping to see that the squad car had hit a fire hydrant or perhaps a brick wall. Instead they saw a white Buick two blocks away, on the curb, and the light pole dancing almost, or at least swaying drunkenly. They watched as the light flickered once, then again, just as each of their homes&#x2019; electricity did during thunderstorms.<br> <br>The Buick backed up. They couldn&#x2019;t read the tags from so far away. Then it started driving toward them.<br> <br>They had been police officers for just under three months now, walking the beats around Auburn Avenue (the neighborhood where both had lived all their lives save the war years) and the West Side, on the other side of downtown. Although Atlanta&#x2019;s eight Negro officers had not yet been entrusted with squad cars, they did have uniforms: black caps with the gold city crest, dark blue shirts on which their shiny badges were pinned, black slacks, and black ties (Smith being one of two cops on the team who went with the bow-tie option, which he found rather dapper). Their thick belts were weighed down by a heavy arsenal of weapons and gear, including firearms, which terrified a number of white people in Atlanta and beyond.<br> <br>Boggs stepped into the road and held out a palm. The white cops may have enjoyed trying to run over their colored colleagues, but civilians were another matter. Or so he hoped. The Buick was driving slower than was normal, as if ashamed. Its headlights glinted off his badge.<br> <br>The Buick stopped.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not turning his engine off,&#x201d; Smith said after a few seconds.<br> <br>Boggs walked over to the driver&#x2019;s door, Smith mirroring him along the sidewalk and stopping at the passenger door. The soles of Smith&#x2019;s shoes hardly made a sound because the cement had been meticulously swept by someone that very morning, not a twig or cigarette butt in sight.<br> <br>The glare from the streetlights had prevented the officers from getting a good look in the car until now. All they had been able to discern were silhouettes of a driver with a hat and a passenger without.<br> <br>Boggs opened his mouth and was about to ask for the driver&#x2019;s license and registration when he saw that the driver was white.<br> <br>That he hadn&#x2019;t expected. What he had suspected, that the driver was drunk, was correct. Boggs was bathed in alcohol fumes as the portly white man gazed at him with something between annoyance and contempt.<br> <br>&#x201c;May I have your license and registration, please, sir?&#x201d;<br> <br>White people were not often found in Sweet Auburn, the wealthiest Negro neighborhood in Atlanta&#x2014;possibly in the world, boosters liked to say. Adventurous whites looking for gambling or whores in the darker parts of town would normally troll along Decatur Street, by the railroad tracks, a half mile to the south. Or they&#x2019;d find one of the other, more nefarious areas that the colored officers patrolled. This fellow was either lost or so drunk and stupid that he figured any colored part of town offered the vices he craved, when in fact this neighborhood mostly held churches, real estate firms, banks, insurance companies, funeral parlors, barbershops, and the sorts of restaurants long closed at this hour. A couple of nightclubs did grace the streets, yes, but they were respectable places where respectable Negroes gathered, and they only opened their doors to whites on Saturdays, when Negroes weren&#x2019;t allowed in.<br> <br>The driver&#x2019;s gray homburg was tipped high, as if he&#x2019;d been rubbing sweat from his forehead. Which he needed to be doing more of, because his skin was still shiny. Hair light gray, blue tie loosened, linen jacket wrinkled. He seemed sweatier than a man driving a car should be, Boggs thought. Like he&#x2019;d just been doing something strenuous.<br> <br>On the other side of the car, Smith visually frisked the man&#x2019;s passenger. She wore the kind of yellow sundress that always made him so thrilled when spring came along, and even here in the depths of summer he was not a man to complain about the kind of heat that allowed the women of Atlanta to walk around half naked. She was short enough to cross her legs in the front seat, the hem above her knee. Light glinted off a small locket that looked stuck to the dampness at the small of her throat.<br> <br>She made eye contact with Smith for only the briefest of seconds, just enough for him to gather a few facts. She was light-skinned and young, early twenties at most. The right side of her lip looked a shade of red that didn&#x2019;t match her lipstick. Red and slightly puffy.<br> <br>Although Smith could not yet see the driver, he divined the man&#x2019;s race based on the subtle change in Boggs&#x2019;s voice when asking for the license. Not exactly deferential, but more polite than was otherwise warranted.<br> <br>The driver answered, &#x201c;No, you may not.&#x201d;<br> <br>Boggs was cognizant of the fact that the man&#x2019;s right hand was at his side, on the seat, and therefore out of view. Boggs decided he need not comment on this yet. Hopefully Smith could see it. The man&#x2019;s left hand casually rested on the steering wheel, the engine still running.<br> <br>&#x201c;You hit a light pole, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I mighta glanced against it.&#x201d; Not even looking at Boggs.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s leaning over and will need to be fixed, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wasting my time, boy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nothing but a crescendo of katydids for a moment, and only then did the white man deign to look at Boggs. Just to check out how that had registered on this uppity Negro&#x2019;s face.<br> <br>Boggs tried not to let it register at all. His face, he knew, was very good at being blank. This had been commented upon by parents, schoolteachers, girlfriends. What are you thinking right now? Where are you? Penny for your thoughts? He&#x2019;d always hated those questions. I&#x2019;m right here. I&#x2019;m thinking thoughts, any thoughts, who knows. And no, you can&#x2019;t buy them.<br> <br>Normally you weren&#x2019;t supposed to look white folks in the eye. But Boggs was the police. This was only the third time he and Smith had dealt with a white perpetrator. Colored officers only patrolled the colored parts of town, where whites were infrequent visitors.<br> <br>&#x201c;I need to see your license and registration, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to see anything, boy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Boggs felt his heart rate spike and he told himself to stay calm. &#x201c;Please turn your car off, sir,&#x201d; he said, realizing he should have started with that.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have the power to arrest me and you know it.&#x201d;<br> <br>On the other side, Smith took this as the proper time to beam the backseat. He didn&#x2019;t see anything there, other than a road atlas on the floorboards. The car was prewar but in good condition, the vinyl shining. Smith aimed his light at the front seat, where the woman had been staring ahead, her hair blocking his view. He had hoped the light would startle her into looking at him, so he could better study her injury and look for others, but she turned farther away.<br> <br>Smith, unlike Boggs, had a good view of the space between driver and passenger. He saw that the man&#x2019;s right hand was resting protectively atop a large brown envelope.<br> <br>&#x201c;I do have the authority to issue you a traffic citation, sir, and I intend to do that,&#x201d; Boggs said. &#x201c;I also have the ability to call white officers here, should your arrest be required. I wouldn&#x2019;t have thought that necessary for something as minor as a traffic violation, but if you want to push things up the ladder with your tone, then I can oblige you.&#x201d;<br> <br>The white man smiled, entertained.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh. Oh, damn. You&#x2019;re one of the smart ones, huh?&#x201d; He nodded, looking Boggs up and down as though finally laying eyes on a new kind of jungle cat the zoo had imported. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very impressed. Y&#x2019;all certainly have come a long way.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir, this is the last time that I&#x2019;ll be the one asking you for your license and registration.&#x201d;<br> <br>Still smiling at Boggs, still not moving.<br> <br>On the other side of the car, Smith asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name, miss?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you talk to her,&#x201d; the white man snapped, turning to the side. All he could have seen from his vantage was Smith&#x2019;s midsection, his badge (yes, we really are cops, sorry for the inconvenience), and perhaps the handle of Smith&#x2019;s holstered gun (yes, it&#x2019;s real).<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you all right, miss?&#x201d; Smith asked the woman. Let&#x2019;s see how the white man likes being ignored. Her face he still couldn&#x2019;t see, though her breaths occasionally made her hair move just enough for him to see the right, bruised side of her lips. Yet she refused to turn.<br> <br>Smith glanced up at his partner over the car roof. Both of them would have loved to see this blowhard arrested, but they weren&#x2019;t sure if Dispatch would bother sending a white squad car for an auto accident whose only victim was an inanimate object. And Atlanta&#x2019;s eight color...</p><h2>Wolf Messing: The True Story of Russia&#39;s Greatest Psychic (English and Russian Edition)</h2><p>Traces the life of Messing, who defeated Stalin&#39;s best efforts to prove his psychic powers a fraud</p><p>Text: English, Russian (translation)</p><h2>The Splendid Wayfaring: Jedediah Smith and the Ashley-Henry Men, 1822-1831</h2><p><p></p><p><i></i></p>With the publication of <i>The Splendid Wayfaring</i> in 1920, John G.

Both counselors and hypnotherapists use techniques that help their clients change undesired habits or achieve personal and professional goals, yet, in spite of their best efforts, some clients still continue to experience unresolved inner conflicts that inhibit them from attaining their ideal empowerment. This book describes an elegant approach to reconciling the conflicting parts of a client&#39;s personality. Closely allied to ego state therapy and voice dialogue, parts therapy uses hypnosis to identify conflicting parts that are damaging the well being of clients. These parts are then directed to negotiate with each other through the therapist to bring about a resolution. Parts therapy continues to grow in popularity and is already used by many psychotherapists and psychologists who use hypnosis as an adjunct to their practices.Therapists who specialize in the use of hypnosis will find Hypnosis for Inner Conflict Resolution: Introducing Parts Therapy a most helpful technique to integrate into their practice.</p><p>Roy Hunter is the best selling author of &#34;The Art of Hypnosis&#34; and &#34;The Art of Hypnotherapy,&#34; and has been teaching professional hypnotherapy for over 15 years.

This book, which is the English language version, is actually the second printing.</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Fundamental Theology</h2><p>An investigation of the central themes of fundamental theology: revelation, hermeneutics, faith and its formulations, and the role of authoritative teaching in the Church. In a clear and balanced manner, Gerald O&#39;Collins sums up the best of Roman Catholic teaching since Vatican II. Students and others who are reflecting on the nature of their Christian belief will find this book invaluable. The unique quality of this work, however, is its foundation in human experience. Before he probes the theological issues, O&#39;Collins lays down a groundwork for understanding experience. It is not an attempt to turn fundamental theology into a subjective science, but it is a recognition that the reality of God always intersects with self-conscious human beings. While it does not touch all of the themes of fundamental theology, the book does provide in-depth treatment of revelation, tradition, and inspiration.</p><p></p><h2>The Russian Revolution 1899 - 1919.</h2><p>An attempt to present a comprehensive view of the Russian Revolution, embracing not only the political and military struggle for power between 1917 and 1920, but also the whole movement towards revolutionizing state, society, economy and culture on a worldwide scale. This first volume is effectively a continuation of Professor Pipes&#39; &#34;Russia Unders the Old Regime&#34;; it focuses on the gradual decay of tsarism culminating in the mutiny of the Petrograd military garrison in Feburary 1917 which brought down Russia&#39;s monarchic government and caused the country to fall apart. It also describes the Bolshevik seizure of power, first in Petrograd, then in the provinces inhabited by Great Russians, imposing on this area a one-party regime with its terror apparatus and centralized economic system. The second volume will concentrate on the aftermath of the Bolshevik coup and the Communist regime as it emerged in the final year of Lenin&#39;s dictatorship.</p><p>"Mr. Pipes writes trenchantly, and at times superbly....No single volume known to me even begins to cater so adequately to those who want to discover what really happened to Russia."--Ronald Hingley, The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"Monumental...Lucidly written, unsurpassed in detail and comprehensiveness."--The Wall Street Journalites trenchantly, and at times superbly....No single volume known to me even begins to cater so adequately to those who want to discover what really happened to Russia....Nor do I know any other book better designed to help Soviet citizens to struggle out of the darkness."<br><br>-- Ronald Hingley, The New York Times Book Review<br><br>Ground-breaking in its inclusiveness, enthralling in its narrative of a movement whose purpose, in the words of Leon Trotsky, was "to overthrow the world," The Russian Revolution draws conclusions that have already aroused great controversy in this country-and that are certain to be explosive when the book is published in the Soviet Union. Richard Pipes argues convincingly that the Russian Revolution was an intellectual, rather than a class, uprising; that it was steeped in terror from its very outset; and that it was not a revolution at all but a coup d'etat -- "the capture of governmental power by a small minority."</p><h2>Bachelor Girl: The Secret History of Single Women in the Twentieth Century</h2><p><p>In this lively and colorful book of popular history, journalist Betsy Israel shines a light on the old stereotypes that have stigmatized single women for years and celebrates their resourceful sense of spirit, enterprise, and unlimited success in a world where it is no longer unusual or unlikely to be unwed.</p> <p>Drawing extensively on primary sources, including private journals, newspaper stories, magazine articles, advertisements, films, and other materials from popular media, Israel paints remarkably vivid portraits of single women -- and the way they were perceived -- throughout the decades. From the nineteenth-century spinsters, of New England to the Bowery girls of New York City, from the 1920s flappers to the 1940s working women of the war years and the career girls of the 1950s and 1960s, single women have fought to find and feel comfortable in that room of their own. One need only look at Bridget Jones and the <em>Sex and the City</em> gang to see that single women still maintain an uneasy relationship with the rest of society -- and yet they radiate an aura of glamour and mystery in popular culture.</p> <p>As witty as it is well researched, as thoughtful as it is lively, <em>Bachelor Girl</em> is a must-read for women everywhere.</p></p><p><p>Betsy Israel is a journalist and former editor who has contributed to the <em>New York Times, Elle, Rolling Stone, GQ, Harper's Bazaar, Redbook, People, Mademoiselle, Vogue, New York, Spin, Playboy</em>, and the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, among many others. She is a former columnist for <em>Glamour, Us</em>, and <em>New York Woman</em> and was a contributing writer for <em>Mirabella</em>. She has written numerous screenplays and is the author of <em>Grown-Up Fast: A True Story of Teenage Life in Suburban America</em>. She lives in Manhattan with her husband and two children. </p>While historians have studied various subsets of women working class, professional, radical, etc., little attention has been paid to the single woman. As journalist Israel documents in this impressive history of single women in America from the Industrial Revolution to modern times, these women have maintained a flourishing subculture, despite attacks and ridicule by the media. While focusing primarily on white, middle-class Manhattan women, Israel draws on a variety of sources, movies, popular novels, magazine and newspaper features that shape the single-woman experience for the broader population. "B-girls" bachelor or bohemian, have always been with us, some from lack of marriage prospects, true, but many by preference. Israel says it's mainly the appeal of the companionship of other women and the desire for independence from marital suppression that keeps these women from tying the knot. Social acceptance of singletons has flip-flopped over the generations. Positive icons, including the emancipated New Woman, settlement house professionals, WWII's Rosie the Riveter, and liberated '70s "chicks," have alternated with scary images of frigid, lonely Old Maids staring at their used-up biological clocks. But even as social critics have changed their tunes about how much rope to allow these women, the women themselves brave factory girls, Bowery Girls, "shoppies," Greenwich Village bohemians, flappers, Murphy Browns and Bridget Joneses have been tough enough to have it "their way." Israel's witty and provocative look at a topic dear to many women deserves wide readership.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>How to Solve All Your Money Problems Forever: Creating a Positive Flow of Money Into Your Life</h2><p>This is a newly revised edition of Victor Boc&#39;s hugely successful, self-published book, previously sold through direct mail.

Hamilton&#39;s startling perspectives on tomorrow&#39;s technological and cultural trends span vast tracts of space and time, his stories are as compelling as they are epic in scope, and yet they are always grounded in characters human, alien and other who, for all their strangeness, still touch our hearts and fire our imaginations. Now, in The Evolutionary Void, Hamilton concludes the highly acclaimed, bestselling Void Trilogy that has unfolded in The Dreaming Void and The Temporal Void. Millions of Leaving Dream pilgrims are on board their immense ultra-drive ships, heading towards and into the Void at the heart of the galaxy. There they expect to live perfect lives in a perfectable world, but the cost of this perfection could not be greater. Among those who will do anything and everything to prevent the pilgrims entering the Void is the genius recluse Ozzie, who&#39;s not quite the man he used to be if he&#39;s a man at all; Gore Burnelli, the oldest and most influential human being alive; the Delivery Man, a one-time faction agent with devastating firepower at his disposal; and the legendary Paula Myo, the Commonwealth&#39;s ruthless, unstoppable field operative. They must succeed if the galaxy is to survive and, needless to say, time is running out ...This is epic SF at its very best. The Evolutionary Void will leave no one in doubt as to why Peter F. Hamilton is Britain&#39;s number one bestselling SF novelist.</p><p>Peter F. Hamilton was born in Rutland in 1960, and still lives near Rutland Water. His previous novels include the Greg Mandel series and the bestselling and groundbreaking Night&#39;s Dawn Trilogy. His most recent novels are Pandora&#39;s Star (2004) and Judas Unchained (2005) -- which constitute the Commonwealth Saga -- and The Dreaming Void (2007), and The Temporal Void (2008) the first two novels in the Void trilogy, of which The Evolutionary Void is the concluding volume.As the story of the Void draws to a close, Hamilton takes up an extraordinary number of threads. Araminta, who has evaded pursuit thus far, comes back from the Silfen paths with a risky plan. Earth, and therefore ANA, is trapped behind a force field. Ilanthe, aims to fuse with the Void and create her own twisted utopia. Gore Burnelli and the Delivery Man seek out the Anomine&#x2019;s means of transcendence. Edeard, in Inigo&#x2019;s dreams, finally gets it right, and Querencia is fulfilled. Inigo and Araminta are finally brought together at the Spike. Inigo at last reveals his final dream, of Querencia after Edeard&#x2019;s ascension. Paula Myo and the Cat finally square off in an epic battle. While Living Dream adherents plan their pilgrimage, others&#x2014;including the Raiel&#x2014;plan their flight from this galaxy, and some will fight to the very end. Eventually, the scattered threads join in the Heart of the Void, where the truth about Makkrathan&#x2019;s origins and the Void itself is revealed. It&#x2019;s an altogether satisfying conclusion to the epic, and one of Hamilton&#x2019;s strongest outings yet: a spectacular space opera. --Regina Schroeder</p><h2>Celebrate Virginia!

Now, for the first time, Peters recounts the personal experiences that shaped his views of the world, from the collapsing Soviet Union to the drug wars of the Andean Ridge, from quiet forays into Burma and Laos to military missions to Pakistan and the Caucasus--and on to the Southwest border of the United States and the meanest streets of Los Angeles. As the U.S. Army's chosen troubleshooter before he took off his uniform to write, Peters saw the greatest international dramas of our times and the personal tragedies they created from a truly unique perspective--and took advantage of every moment "outside of the wire." <p>The result is startling: the liveliest adventure memoir by an American in decades, a perfect balance of high drama and laugh-out-loud hilarity. Readers--among them his many devoted fans--will meet a faded beauty and former favorite singer of Josef Stalin's, now in her nineties and still a hopeless coquette; KGB officers who refuse to let go of the past in Moscow's back streets; a winsome princess adrift in a dying world; the corrupt Thai police general whose hobby was imitating Elvis to karaoke machines in rural bordellos; sentimental Caucasian gangsters; oblivious diplomats; wary Burmese colonels; doomed Mexican drug cops; Mennonite marijuana farmers; lonesome Nazi widows in Bolivia--and their Jewish friends; Muslim fundamentalists who write love poetry to imagined sweethearts . . . and, above all, the author's two loyal brothers-in-arms who sometimes shared the dangers and the wonder at the "back of beyond" and whose remarkable personal backgrounds, dashingly eccentric personalities, and appetite for adventure explode every clich� about military officers. </p><p>Beautifully written and hauntingly told, <i>Looking for Trouble</i> is simply the book Ralph Peters was born to write. We can all be glad that he came back alive to write it.</p></p><p>"Ralph Peters has produced a literary masterpiece in this account of a modern-day adventurer whose job it was to go to the ends of the earth. Peters writes with the same amount of guts he displayed in the service of his country--going where few would dare go, while calling things as he sees them. Highly polished and keenly insightful." Colonel James R. McDonough, U.S. Army, Infantry (retd.) and author of Platoon Leader <p>"A fascinating, compelling, and insightful memoir, wonderfully told. Ralph Peters delivers again. A superb book." Major General Sid Shachnow, U.S. Army Special Forces (retd.) Author of the bestseller Hope and Honor</p> <p>"Every generation produces an adventurer who captures key moments in unexpected places that define the times. Ralph Peters is our generation's man and he nailed it--for those of us who witnessed the end of empire, there isn't a more brilliant, compellingly written memoir on a shelf anywhere." Colonel Tom "The Man Who Would Be Khan" Wilhelm, U.S. Army (retd.)</p>FROM POIGNANT encounters in the ruins of Russia to surreal road trips in the Middle East, from face-offs with swastika-flaunting thugs in Armenia to a long Asian night in the company of the world's most dangerous Elvis impersonator, Ralph Peters' recounting of his remarkable--and sometimes downright bizarre--travels as an unorthodox intelligence officer glide between the haunting and the hilarious. <p>Sent off to sift the wreckage of other people's conflicts or assigned to investigate strategic crises first-hand, Peters traveled-- alone or in the company of a few remarkable fellow soldiers--to the badlands of Pakistan and darkness-at-noon Burma, into Iraq on foot and down the drug-ravaged streets of Los Angeles. Whether dodging cocaine cowboys in the Andean Ridge or walking alone into fundamentalist-run refugee camps, Peters brings his adventures and misadventures to romping life in a beautifully written book that's also laugh-out-loud funny. </p><p>Looking for Trouble's dramatic settings range from a Kremlin basement to safe houses in Mexico, and its driving issues move from the collapse of empires to the fate of our POW/MIAs, but its true subjects are the unforgettable characters that leap to life in these pages: a dangerous narco-general determined to keep the disco era alive; an insanely brave Special Forces officer who sneaks into Taliban-run Afghanistan to play polo; a wistful princess trapped in a lost world; a dashing Hungarian-American Army captain who has a genius for getting into--then back out of--trouble; a happy-go-lucky gangster whose luck runs out just before dawn; doomed Mexican cops and KGB hard-liners; gunmen and militias of various descriptions; an Army major who could be mistaken for a knight arrived by time machine from seventeenth-century Poland; and with guest appearances by the Buddha and Boris Yeltsin. </p><p>Sometimes by design, at other times by dumb luck, Ralph Peters was on the spot to see the global storm clouds gathering: the rise of Islamist extremism, the spread of murderous warrior culture, the breakdown of fragile states, and above all, the human stories crushed beneath the headlines. </p><p>Fans of Ralph Peters' writing on strategy and military affairs will recognize the sources of his ahead-of-its-time thinking in these pages--but this luminous book is, at heart, a love letter to lost worlds and splendid friends. Above all, it's enormous fun to read. </p><p>RALPH PETERS has been a lifelong traveler, in and out of uniform, with experience in 70 countries on six continents--and has a talent for spotting (and enjoying) crises. After rising from the rank of Army private, he retired shortly after his promotion to lieutenant colonel to write with greater freedom. His twenty-three published books, written under his own name and as Owen Parry, include influential works on strategy and security affairs, prize- winning historical novels, and bestselling thrillers. An opinion columnist for the New York Post, Peters has written for a wide range of publications and is a frequent media commentator.

It brings together for the first time many of the finest contributions to transitionl.c. ok , a magazine of art and literature published in Paris between 1927 and 1932 by the poet Eugene Jolas and critic Elliot Paul. For its time, transition was a mouthpiece of high modernism unmatched by any other journal in Europe, and most of the great avant-garde writers (and many artists) of that era are represented here: Kafka, Rilke, Joyce and Gide, for example. Yet, what is most important is Of particular interest are not the pieces by acknowledged masters but the contributions by their pk then largely unknown disciples--most of them, like Jolas and Paul, American expatriates. By comparison, many of these American writers, such as Malcolm Cowley, Laura Riding and Harry Crosby, appear repetitive and reductive in their style, adhering more to modernism's rhetoric than to its spirit. In this light, it is clear how Hemingway became a popular modernist icon for Americans and why Hart Crane remains underappreciated by the public. In Transition might just help to sway that balance.

You take refuge in an empty office like frightened cockroaches, but the doors are forced open, revealing your antenna-quivering vulnerability. In desperation, you scramble up and down elevator shafts with one lame leg dangling helplessly behind, and try other life-threatening feats that seem to be more appealing than getting an ice-pick through your skull. <p> The most horrifying thing about this scenario: the person chasing you is not a disgruntled co-worker, and it's not your boss! It's a notoriously murderous rapist, and he's just about to get you or Sarah every turn of the way. And then you remember the terror of falling while climbing Mount Everest and you think you've figured out how to escape... but have you?

To their horror, four-year-old Courtenay fails to return home from preschool, and it doesn't take long for them to realize that she's the victim of kidnappingor worse. The book chronicles what happens, including the involvement of police, other agencies, and private individuals as they assemble around the grief-stricken family to help them deal with the situation and to put into effect the mechanisms to search for the missing child. There's a great deal of information concerning how a missing child search works; in fact, occasionally the weight of the information intrudes upon the novel. Despite that, however, the suspense builds steadily throughout, as readers try to determine not only what has happened to Courtenay and at whose hands, but also who is making harassing and suggestive phone calls to Maggie. One of the solutions is fairly predictable, but the other comes as a real surprise. Middle school readers, including reluctant ones, will really care what happens to Courtenay and her family.

Hardly a Colorado town or mining camp could be found where stagecoach wheels had not left their tracks. In the winter wheels were often exchanged for runners so that the coach could travel through deep Colorado snow. We can only imagine what it was really like to travel hundreds of miles in a swaying stagecoach with hard, wooden benches for seats, often with only fifteen inches of space to yourself. Stage passengers often encountered rainstorms, wind, thunder and lightning, mud, snow, and rockslides, all with only a thin piece of canvas to protect them from inclement weather. But this was the premier way to travel. Passengers often overlooked the hardships and only remembered the speed, the beauty, and the excitement of a Colorado stagecoach trip.</p><p>Born in Iowa, Marril Lee Burke has lived most of her &#34;grown-up&#34; years in Colorado, owning and operating a small ski resort, raising seven children, becoming a Master Gardener, writing a column for the local Montrose, Colorado newspaper, and taking inspiration for her first book from an old stagecoach route that wound through a ranch she has owned since 1971 near the Lake Fork of the Gunnison River. &#34;Stagecoaching,&#34; says Marril Lee, &#34; is a somewhat untouched era of U.S. history, relatively ignored by writers to date.&#34; In her book, Mrs. Burke captures the feel of the time when stagecoaches connected the remote towns of Colorado.</p><h2>The Spiritual Teachings of Ralph Waldo Emerson</h2><p>No one who has felt the life-changing pull of Emerson's enormous planetary mind has ever doubted his power or his greatness, though we are often puzzled to know whether he is primarily a poet, an essayist or a philosopher. <br><br>Richard Geldard is not puzzled at all by this; he has written a book that plainly shows Emerson to be essentially a teacher, the Socrates of Concord, a man with a message that we need to hear today. Previous generations "beheld God and nature face to face," Emerson says, and adds provocatively that we moderns seem able only to see those things through the eyes of the earlier generations. "Why," he asks-and the question is intended to shatter our complacency-"Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe? Why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of insight and not of tradition, and a religion by revelation to us, and not the history of theirs?" <br><br>Emerson's life was devoted to showing how one may still attain an original, that is to say, an authentic, relation to the universe, and Geldard's book aims to focus and distill the famously dispersed Emerson and put his central teachings into the modern reader's hand. <br><br> Previous edition titled<i> The Esoteric Emerson: the Spiritual Teachings of Ralph Waldo Emerson</i>. <br><br>Click here to read an interview with the author, Richard Geldard</p><p><b>Richard Geldard</b> is a graduate of Bowdoin College, The Bread Loaf School of English at Middlebury College, and Stanford University, where he earned his doctorate in Dramatic Literature and Classics.

A brilliant sun was accompanied by temperatures in the midseventies. The campus of Duke University was peaceful and relatively empty with the arrival of spring break. Dukies, with the exception of athletic teams in season such as mens lacrosse, welcomed the reprieve. The city of Durham, meanwhile, embraced a new work week. Durhamites savored the crisp, clean air as they scurried around town and tackled their to-do lists. Little did they know the perfect storm had started to churn on the horizon. </p><p> The Perfect Storm? </p><p> Yes, thats exactly what would occur. Not a drop of rain would fall in Durham over the next twelve hours, but an extraordinary combination of events would devastate a prestigious university and a proud city, changing many lives forever. Not rain, not snow, not wind would cause this massive destruction. </p><p> The elements that produced this perfect storm were in a powder keg, just waiting to be ignited. That powder keg, located in the living room at 610 North Buchanan Boulevard, was packed with the politics of privilege, race, sex, and money. As the alcohol flowed, and music filled the air, the fuse was lit. </p><p> There was an explosion around midnight. </p><p> </p><p> Duke University, ranked as the thirteenth Best University in the World in 2006 by the <i>New York Times Higher Education Supplement</i>, is extraordinarily picturesque. Grand Gothic buildings covered in warm, gold- toned brick stand high above the magnolia and dogwood trees that fill the campus. An aura of privilege and excellence surround the thousands of eager, bright students who pay an annual tuition in excess of forty-four thousand dollars and rush to keep pace with their demanding academic and social schedules. However, the university's beautiful exterior couldn't conceal the turmoil beneath. </p><p> People love to hate Duke. Though no one can pinpoint exactly why, everyone has a theory. John Burness, Dukes senior vice president for public affairs and government relations, believes it stems from the school's reputation. Once the darling underdog, Duke is now viewed as a powerful elitist. Its attitude, intellect, and wealth set an exclusive standard, similar to the success exhibited by professional baseball's New York Yankees. Most of the Ivy League despise the thought that Duke is trying to be something it's not: one of them. In the Ivies' minds, Duke is a poser, striving to emulate an image Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Stanford, Brown, Columbia, Dartmouth, and the University of Pennsylvania spent centuries developing. </p><p> "I really believe that if this had occurred almost anywhere else in the country, it wouldn't have been this big," Burness said. "It would have been big, but nowhere as big as Duke. We are on a pedestal. I think the factor that put this one over the top, with all the other elements -- and God, it had all the other elements -- was that this was Duke." </p><p> Those "other elements": </p><p> </p><p> Outside the "Duke Bubble," as many students call it, you enter Durham, a vibrant and growing city that can also be especially dangerous in places. It was the murder capital of North Carolina in 2005, boasting thirty-seven murders, the highest murder rate per capita. Though not all of Durham adheres to the poor, blue-collar family image the media portrays, nevertheless, its crime rate and poverty levels are alarming. The contrast between the surrounding community and the young, elite, predominately white Dukie is startling and cause for friction. The national media have described Durham as "a small Southern town where conflict over race and class dominates daily life." Even the <i>Princeton Review</i> noted in 2006 that "Duke and Durham have one of the most strained town-gown relationships in the nation." </p><p> Duke's president, Richard Brodhead, entered uncharted waters when he walked onto Duke's campus four years earlier. He was a shy, scholarly man from Yale, and big-time sports at the Division I level were foreign to him. Brodhead was unsure how to balance athletics and academics, a combination that Duke views with beaming pride. In fact, 10 percent of Duke's undergraduate students are athletes. Brodhead speaks in long, elegant passages and often quotes Shakespeare. His timid, calm demeanor is surprising for a man of such power. In the midst of this struggle to establish himself, he was forced to manage a faculty becoming more vocally radical in its political views. Brodhead had watched just a month earlier as his contemporary Harvard President Lawrence Summers fell victim to that university's more extreme professors and wanted to ensure he didnt suffer a similar fate. It was a balancing act that could easily tip with the slightest disturbance. </p><p> Mike Nifong was nearing the end of his term as Durham's interim district attorney. Despite the promise he had made to Governor Mike Easley, Nifong went back on his word and decided to run for the office. However, he trailed badly in the polls to a former colleague in the district attorney's office, Freda Black, who helped successfully handle the explosive and televised Michael Peterson murder case in 2003. As the gap between the two candidates grew, so did Nifong's desperation: He used thirty thousand dollars of his own money to continue campaigning. What he needed was a moment that would guarantee him free publicity. </p><p> Some police officers seemed to specifically target Duke students. Sergeant Mark Gottlieb had arrested ten times as many Duke students as the district's other three squad commanders combined. Students whom he had arrested alleged that Gottlieb occasionally used violent tactics and misrepresented the truth in court. Gottlieb arrested or incarcerated Duke students at a higher rate than nonstudents, even when they were accused of less serious crimes than the nonstudents, according to a news report. </p><p> Duke's lacrosse team had, in the minds of some, developed a reputation for living loud and large. Players were athletic, smart, and handsome, a trifecta that generated adulation and envy. "In the order of the social universe of Duke undergraduates, the lacrosse players ranked at the top of the dominance hierarchy," wrote Peter J. Boyer of <i>The New Yorker</i>. They tended to be the children of white, prosperous families, products of Northeastern preparatory schools, where the game is a fixture; after graduation most of them go on to lucrative careers in fields like finance...they were also known as enthusiastically social creatures, partiers of the very highest order. The team exemplified the Duke student body motto of "work hard, play hard," causing resentment on and off campus. The team traveled in packs and "got all the best women," joked former Duke lacrosse captain Matt Zash. Though many involved with the team would dispute the image, <i>Baltimore Sun</i> columnist David Steel wrote, "It's a sport of privilege played by children of privilege and supported by families of privilege." </p><p> Add to this volatile mixture two African-American strippers -- with criminal records and wild imaginations. Kim Roberts, who went by the stage name Nikki, dropped out of college after two years when she got pregnant. She married the father of her child but was divorced soon after. After she took a job as a payroll specialist, her employers caught her stealing twenty-five thousand dollars. Embezzlement charges stood in the way of any future employment, so she began stripping. Crystal Gail Mangum, also known as Precious, was a North Carolina Central University student and divorced mother of two. It was known within the community that she had a history of mental instability and abused drugs and alcohol. In 2002, Mangum pled guilty to misdemeanor charges of larceny, speeding to elude arrest, assault on a government official, and driving while impaired. </p><p> The perfect storm. </p><p> </p><p> On the afternoon of March 13, Duke's nationally ranked lacrosse team searched for ways to escape the spring-break boredom. Golf was a popular option. Many other guys spent the afternoon at 610 North Buchanan Boulevard, drinking beer, talking about women, and playing an outdoor game called washers. In this version, players tossed small washers underhand through holes cut into wooden panes the size of doors on the ground five feet away. When conversation turned to the night's entertainment, faces lit up. A few years ago the team unveiled a tradition of meeting at Teaser's Mens Club one night during spring break. However, players had run into a problem that threatened the fun at this local strip club: Some of their underage teammates were carded and denied entry in 2005. In what they thought was a stroke of genius, the players decided to bring the strip club to them. "The reality is that every guy that we know in every fraternity and on every sports team had had strippers to their house," one player said. "We thought, 'Whats the downside?' We could control what we got. The thinking was we needed to control the atmosphere." </p><p> The elements began to spin. </p><p> In this age of instant access, there's no need to flip through Durham's 151-page telephone book to find live entertainment. The Internet was easier. Only a few keystrokes were needed to find escort services and dancers on yellowpages.com. Among the first to pop up: Allure Escort Services. No one knew, when one of the team's four lacrosse captains, Dan Flannery, made the call, using the name Dan Flannigan, that his afternoon call would ring in the ghetto of East Durham. "The address is actually an out-of-service gas station on some random street," senior lacrosse captain Matt Zash recalls. "It's just a front. It doesn't even exist. It's just someone with a cell phone that has a network of girls that he can call up." </p><p> After first dialing a number that was out of order, Flannery punched in the telephone number for Allure Escort Services in his cellular phone at 2:00 P.M. He had a connection. A ring followed. Flannery explained he was looking for entertainment for a party. </p><p> "What do you want?...</p></p><h2>The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success for Parents</h2><p>The first in a new series of books based on the Seven Spiritual Laws principle.

The author is a strong critic of the Federal Republic&#39;s standard response that the injustices perpetrated on the German people &#39;by foreign powers are rooted in injustices committed by the National Socialist regime&#39;, and consequently the Germans &#39;must abstain from making their own demands for compensation against these states&#39;. Dr Nordbruch exposes the hypocrisy of such self-protective assertions. He concentrates on giving the reader unadulterated depictions of the premeditated mass atrocities connected with expulsion and deportation of German people, as well as the mass rape of German women and girls, and the Allied campaigns of methodical plunder throughout Germany. He does not omit the well-documented tortures and murders of millions of German civilians and prisoners of war in both East and West, and he devotes an entire chapter to the question of foreign workers in the Third Reich. This is compared with the historical facts about the question of German forced labourers. Nordbruch is the first author to document the actual extent of exploitation of German labour by the victorious powers, Bolshevistic as well as &#39;democratic&#39;. After an extensive investigation of these issues, the author presents Germany&#39;s ethical and political grounds for claiming restitution. He provides a thorough explanation of the legal arguments supporting such compensation under international law. Bleeding Germany Dry is an accurate and hard-hitting revision of Nordbruch historical events that for over half a century have had a decisive influence on the policies of Berlin and Vienna.</p><p></p><h2>The Usborne Book of World Religions (World Religions Series)</h2><p>Discusses Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, and other religions past and present, and includes a time chart and a compilation of religious sayings</p><p></p><h2>Anatomy Drawing School: Animal Anatomy</h2><p>The Anatomy Drawing School&#x2015;Animal anatomy recognizes the prominent role of the anatomy for the fine arts.

Linda exploresthat turbulent time in <i>The Yankee Widow.</i><br><br><em>Arizona Territory, August 12, 1888</em><br><br>Holt McKettrick hooked a finger under his fancy collar in a vain effort to loosen it a little. Wedding guests milled on the wide, grassy stretch of ground alongside the Triple M ranch house, their finery dappled by shivering patches of shade from the young oaks thriving there. Two fiddlers played a mournful rendition of "Lorena," and there was a whole hog roasting in the pit Holt's three half brothers had dug in the ground and lined with flat rocks from the creek. The wedding cake, baked by Holt's sisters-in-law, was the size of a buckboard, and a long table&#x2014;an improvised arrangement of planks supported by half a dozen fifty-gallon barrels&#x2014;wobbled under the weight of a week's worth of fancy grub.<br><br>The old man and the rest of the McKettrick outfit had spared no effort or expense to make the gathering memorable. Holt reckoned he might have enjoyed it as much as the next fellow&#x2014;if he hadn't been the bridegroom.<br><br>A hand struck his back in jovial greeting, and Holt nearly spilled his cup of fruit punch, generously laced with whiskey from his brother Rafe's flask, down the front of his dandy suit.<br><br>"I reckon that's the preacher, yonder," said Holt's father, Angus McKettrick, nodding toward an approaching rider splashing across the sun-dazzled creek, driving his horse hard. "'Bout time he showed up. I was beginning to think we'd have to send somebody out to the mission to fetch that crippled-up padre."<br><br>Holt swallowed, squinted. Heat prickled the back of his neck. Something stirred in him, a sweet, aching feeling like he got on hot summer nights, when a high-country breeze curled around his brain like a voice calling him back to Texas.<br><br>"I reckon," he muttered. Holt wondered where Rafe had gotten to with that flask, though he didn't look away from the rider to search the crowd.<br><br>The newcomer, his features hidden in the glare of midafternoon light, spurred his horse up the creek bank on the near side, man and mount flinging off diamonds of water as they came.<br><br>"Margaret is a fine woman," Angus said. He had a way of cutting a statement loose without laying any groundwork first.<br><br>"Who?" Holt asked, distracted. The skin between his shoulder blades itched, and his chest felt wet beneath the starched cotton of his shirtfront.<br><br>"Your bride," Angus answered, with a note of exasperation. Out of the corner of his eye, Holt saw his father tug at the knot in his string tie. Like as not, his wife, Concepcion, had cinched it tight as a corset ribbon.<br><br>The rider gained the edge of the yard and dismounted with the hasty grace of a seasoned cowpuncher, leaving the reins to dangle. He came straight for Holt.<br><br>"That ain't the preacher," Angus remarked unnecessarily, and with concern. Though he had almost no formal education, the old man read till his eyes gave out, and when he let his grammar slip, it meant he was agitated.<br><br>Holt glanced toward the house, where Miss Margaret Tarquin, his bride-to-be, was shut away in an upstairs bedroom getting herself gussied up for the wedding, then went to meet the messenger. The fiddle-playing ground to a shrill halt, and a silence settled over the crowd. Even the kids and the dogs were quiet.<br><br>"I'm lookin' for Holt Cavanagh," the newly arrived young man announced. His denim trousers were wet with creek water, and he shivered, despite the shimmering heat of that August afternoon. "You'd be him, I reckon?"<br><br>Holt nodded in brusque acknowledgment. It didn't occur to him to explain that he'd set aside the name Ca-vanagh, once he and the old man had made their blustery peace, and went by McKettrick these days.<br><br>Angus stuck close, bristly brows lowered, and Rafe, Kade and Jeb, elusive until then, seemed to materialize out of the rippling mirages haunting the grounds like ghosts. Holt and his brothers had had their differences in the three years they'd been acquainted&#x2014;still did&#x2014;but blood was blood. If the rider brought good news, they'd celebrate. If it was bad, they'd do what they could to help. And if there was trouble in the offing, they'd wade right into the fray and ask for the particulars later.<br><br>Holt's affection for them, though sometimes grudging, was in his marrow.<br><br>The visitor handed over a slip of paper. "Frank Cor-rales told me to give you this. He sent you a telegram, and when you didn't answer, he figured it didn't go through and told me to hit the trail. I carried that there letter all the way from Texas."<br><br>A shock of alarm surged through Holt, like venom from an invisible snake. He hesitated slightly, then snatched the soggy sheet of brown paper and unfolded it with a snap of his wrist. He felt his father and brothers move a stride closer.<br><br>He took in the words in a glance, absorbed the implications, and read them again to make sure he had the right of the situation.<br><br>JOHN CAVANAGH ABOUT TO BE DRIVEN OFF HIS LAND.<br><br>GABE TO HANG FOR A HORSE THIEF AND A MURDERER ON THE FIRST OF OCTOBER. COME QUICK.<br><br>FRANK CORRALES<br><br>Holt was still digesting the news when a feminine voice jarred him out of his stupor, and a slender hand came to rest on his coat sleeve. "Holt? Is something wrong?"<br><br>Holt started slightly, turned his head to look down into the upturned face of his bride-to-be, resplendent in her lacy finery and gossamer veil. She was a pretty woman, with fair hair and expressive blue eyes, a sent-for wife, imported all the way from Boston. Holt never looked at her without a stab of guilt; Margaret deserved a man who loved her, not one who wanted a mother for his young daughter, a bed companion for himself and not much else.<br><br>"I've got to go back to Texas," he said. The words had been shambling along the far borders of his mind for a long while, but this was the first time he'd let them come to the fore, let alone find their way out of his mouth.<br><br>Angus cleared his throat, and the whole party started up again, like it was some sort of signal. Reluctantly, Rafe, Kade and Jeb moved off, and Angus handed the rider a five-dollar gold piece, then steered him toward the food table.<br><br>One of the ranch hands took care of the exhausted horse.<br><br>Margaret's smile faltered a little as she gazed up at Holt, waiting.<br><br>"Maybe when I get back..." he began awkwardly, but then his voice just fell away.<br><br>She sighed, shook her head. "I don't believe I want to wait, Holt," she said. "If that's what you're asking me to do, I mean."<br><br>He touched her face, let his hand fall back to his side. "I'm sorry," he rasped, and he was, truly, though he doubted it would count for much in the grand scheme of things. At his brothers' urging, he'd brought this woman out from the east, and now here she was, all got up in a bridal gown, with half the territory in attendance, and there wasn't going to be a wedding.<br><br>"I'll go ahead and marry you anyhow," he said, against his every instinct, because he was Angus McKettrick's son and a deal was a deal. But he couldn't make himself sound like that was what he wanted, and Margaret was no fool. "I've still got to leave, though, either way."<br><br>A tear shimmered on her cheek, but Margaret held her chin high, shook her head again. "No," she said, with sad pride. "If you really wanted me for a wife, you'd have gone ahead with the ceremony, put a ring on my finger so everybody would know I was taken, maybe even asked me to come along."<br><br>"It'll be a hard trip," Holt said. From a verbal standpoint, he felt like a lame cow, turning in fruitless circles, trying to find its way out of a narrow place in the trail.<br><br>Nonetheless, he kept right on struggling. "Hard things to attend to, too, once I get there."<br><br>She worked up another smile. "Godspeed, Holt Mc-Kettrick," she said. Then, to his profound chagrin, she turned to face the gathering.<br><br>All attempts at merriment ceased, and a hush fell.<br><br>"There will be no wedding today," Margaret announced, in a clear voice, while everyone stared back at her in bleak sympathy. Her spine, Holt noted, with admiration, was straight as a new fence post. "But there <em>will </em>be a party. I'm going upstairs right now and change out of this silly dress, and when I come back down again, I expect to find every last one of you making merry."<br><br>With that, Margaret started for the house. Holt's sisters-in-law, Emmeline, Mandy and Chloe, all flung poisonous glances in his direction and hurried after his retreating almost-bride.<br><br>Only Lizzie, Holt's twelve-year-old daughter, had the temerity to approach him, and her cheeks glowed pink with indignation.<br><br>"Papa," she demanded, coming to a stop directly in front of him, "how <em>could </em>you?"<br><br>Holt loved his child, though he hadn't known she'd existed until last year, and except for Margaret herself, Lizzie was the hardest person in the crowd to face just then. "I've got business in Texas," he said, because that was the stark truth and he had nothing else to offer. "It can't wait."<br><br>Lizzie stiffened, blinked her large hazel eyes, and bit her lower lip. "You're leaving?"<br><br>He reached out to lay a hand on her shoulder, but she shrank from him.<br><br>"Lizzie," he whispered.<br><br>She turned on her heel, fled to her grandfather. Angus put an arm around the child and glowered at Holt. The old man looked like Zeus himself, shooting thunderbolts from his eyes.<br><br>"Hell," Holt muttered, and started for the barn.<br><br>His brothers fell in beside him, their faces hard. Holt lengthened his stride, but they stuck to his heels like barn muck. Stubborn cusses, cut from the same itchy cloth as their pa, every one of them.<br><br>"What the hell is going on here?" Rafe snarled. The firstborn of Angus's three younger sons, Rafe was a bull of a man, and always the first to demand an accounting. He and Kade and Jeb formed a semicircle in front of Holt, barring his way into the barn, where his horse was stabled, blissfully unaware of the long, arduous ride ahead.<br><br>Holt might have shoved his way through, if he hadn't figured that would lead to a fight. He wasn't afraid of tangling, but a brawl would mean a delay, and the need to get where he was going made an urgent clench in the pit of his belly.<br><br>He pulled out the crumpled letter, thrust into his vest pocket earlier, and shoved it at Kade, who happened to be the one standing directly in front of him. "See for yourself," he said.<br><br>Kade scanned the page, while Jeb and Rafe peered at it from either side.<br><br>"I'll saddle your horse," Kade said, handing it back. He was the middle brother, the thoughtful, practical one. "Best pack yourself some of that wedding grub, too, for the trail."<br><br>"Have a word with Lizzie before you go, Holt," Rafe interjected. "She doesn't look like she's taking this real well."<br><br>"I could ride along," Jeb put in, with typical eagerness.<br><br>The youngest of the brood, he was also the fastest gun, and hands-down the best rider. Jeb was handy to have around in a tight place, for those reasons and a few others, but the plain and simple truth was that Holt didn't want to have to look out for him. He wasn't fool enough to say so, though.<br><br>He might have grinned, if he hadn't just humiliated a fine woman and learned that two of the best friends he'd ever had were in trouble. Jeb had a wife to look after, and a baby daughter, barely walking. Rafe and Kade were in the same situation, since all three of their brides had managed to come a-crop with babies a year ago last Independence Day.<br><br>"This is my fight," Holt said. "I'll handle it."<br><br>Rafe looked thoughtful. "John Cavanagh. That's the man who raised you, isn't it?"<br><br>Holt nodded, though Rafe's assessment didn't begin to cover what Cavanagh meant to him. "He's got a spread outside San Antonio."<br><br>"And this Gabe yahoo...?" Jeb fished. "Who's he?"<br><br>"We were Rangers together," Holt explained. Gabe Navarro was a wild man&#x2014;part Comanche, part Mexican, part devil&#x2014;but he was neither a murderer nor a horse thief. Holt had known him too long and too well ever to believe either accusation.<br><br>Apparently satisfied, Kade headed into the barn to get Holt's horse, Traveler, ready.<br><br>Rafe and Jeb went to the feast table and commenced gathering food for the journey. Holt looked for Lizzie and found her still in Angus's arms, her head resting against the old man's broad shoulder.<br><br>"Here, now," Angus murmured, giving his eldest son an unfriendly but resigned glance as Holt approached.<br><br>"You talk to your papa, Lizzie-beth. It's no good parting without saying what needs to be said."<br><br>Lizzie sniffled, raised her head, and met Holt's gaze.<br><br>Angus squeezed her upper arm, then favoring Holt with a withering glare, he walked away.<br><br>"Are you coming back?" Lizzie wanted to know.<br><br>"Yes," Holt said, with certainty. He wasn't through with Texas&#x2014;he'd left too many things undone there&#x2014; but in the deepest part of his heart, he knew the Arizona Territory and the Triple M were home.

On the surface, it is a civilized and cultured place, where only the occasional conspiracy, assassination, revolution or invasion by orcs, goblins, beastmen, or mutants disrupts the feudal order. Yet a shadow hangs over the world, cast by the corrupting hand of Chaos. From the Imperial court in Altdorf to the pirate-ridden coast of south Tilea, a few heroes strive to hold back the forces of howling Chaos, while it&#39;s hidden servants scheme from within to bring the world to it&#39;s knees before the Dark Gods.&#34; Warhammer FRP is a role-playing game set in the Warhammer world, a background developed by Games Workshop and used in the best-selling Warhammer Fantasy Battles and Warhammer Quest games. The three games are compatible, and characters can be transferred between them with a little fiddling. The Warhammer world is a grim place of perilous adventure. It&#39;s a little like Europe at the time of the early Renaissance, with all its corruption, villainy and opportunities for adventure; but this is a world of inhuman races, wizards, mutants, terrifying monsters and the dread shadow of Chaos, which stretches over the entire land. In WFRP, Chaos is not just a force of nature, but a living, malevolent thing supported by demonic princes who will not rest until the entire world has been enslaved or destroyed. It&#39;s a dark game with an atmosphere of psychological and visceral horror, and a subtle seam of dark humour at its heart.</p><p></p><h2>Disease: The Extraordinary Stories Behind History&#39;s Deadliest Killers</h2><p>The compelling and sometimes frightening stories of 30 deadly diseases and of humanity&#39;s efforts to combat them.</p><p></p><h2>Manhunters</h2><p>Working faithfully for a Texas rancher despite his family&#39;s warnings, Chacho Fernandez steals his payment when his dishonest employer refuses to compensate him and is falsely accused of murdering a lawman.

Through events set in motion by a misunderstanding, Chacho becomes a folk hero to his people and a dangerous fugitive to a group of zealous lawmen. Manhunters, the tale of Chacho&#39;s legendary flight, was inspired by the story of controversial Mexican fugitive Gregorio Cortez. In 1901 Cortez, a young horseman, shot a sheriff during an argument, leading to the largest concerted manhunt in Texas history.<p>It began with a misunderstanding that exploded into a killing. In no time at all, Chacho went from being a respected horse handler -- to being a hunted fugitive. And there was no doubt that the law was coming for him, because the man he shot was a gringo. The Texas Rangers sent one of their finest to find the Mexican boy -- and he did.

All were 27.<br><br>Journalists write about the curse of the 27 Club&#x201d; as if there is a supernatural reason for this series of deaths. Others invoke astrology, numerology, and conspiracy theories to explain what has become a modern mystery. In this haunting book, author Howard Sounes conducts the definitive forensic investigation into the lives and deaths of the six most iconic members of the Club, plus another forty-four music industry figures who died at 27, to discover what, apart from coincidence, this phenomenon signifies.<br><br>In a grimly fascinating journey through the dark side of the music business over six decades, Sounes uncovers a common story of excess, madness, and self-destruction. The fantasies, half-truths, and mythologies that have become associated with Jones, Hendrix, Joplin, Morrison, Cobain, and Winehouse are debunked.

More to the point, it also shows him to have been among the foremost painters of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. As a good figure painter, especially of children, and a talented colourist, he was sensitive to the aims of the Brotherhood and a leading exponent of their technical practices. Over 80 when he died in the early years of</p><p>Arthur Hughes was an important if elusive Pre-Raphaelite artist (1832-1915) known for only a few works. Having achieved preeminence early in his career, he no longer met with critical acclaim by the 1860s, when the Pre-Raphaelite influences on British painting had largely passed. This catalogue raisonne performs the valuable task of bringing together the artist's works from a wide variety of sources and is now the standard reference work on Hughes; it will contribute in no small measure to restoring his reputation. Stephen Wildman has written a biographical introduction using all the available documentation and the artist's large number of surviving letters. The catalogue, which provides the fullest information on each painting, is a model of scholarly research and is unlikely to be replaced for a long time. The illustrations are well done and the book is well produced. A valuable reference work at a very reasonable price; for every serious art library.?Martin Chasin, Adult Inst., Bridgeport, CT<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>One Size Doesn&#39;t Fit All</h2><p>As only John Madden can tell them, here are stories of freewheeling adventures aboard the famous &#34;Maddencruiser&#34;--Madden&#39;s customized Greyhound bus. Includes Madden&#39;s opinions on everything from pets to politics and the names of the all-new, all-Madden team. HC: Villard.</p><p><b>John Madden</b> has been involved with football at every level for forty years, as a player, coach, and commentator. He was the winning coach in Super Bowl XI with the Oakland Raiders and has won eleven emmy awards as a broadcaster. He is the author of four books, three of which have been <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers. He lives in Pleasanton, California.This is the third collaboration between Madden, TV football analyst and ex-NFL coach, and New York Times sports columnist Anderson, following Hey, Wait a Minute! and One Knee Equals Two Feet. In this self-portrait Madden himself bears out his contention that one size doesn't fit all, i.e., that each of us is unique. He is revealed as delightfully unique as we read about crosscountry travels on his bus (he dislikes flying), the people he meets, his passion for Mexican food (always go to the worst part of town for the best restaurant, he advises), his reasons for leaving his shoelaces untied. He also tackles such subjects as raising children and handling athletes. Madden proves himself to be a down-to-earth, take-me-or-leave-me guy, and it will be the rare reader who won't want to take him. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Laura Owens</h2><p>Laura Owens is among a select group of artists credited with the rebirth of American painting. She has developed a style all her own, moving from landscape to abstraction in energetic thick brushstrokes, fanciful childlike doodles, or sophisticated fine line drawings. &#34;Each painting can act as a question,&#34; she says, and, demonstrating a wide and imaginative range, she constantly experiments and redefines her work. &#34;Ultimately, you want to make the painting that you want to be with, not one that is constantly telling you everything it knows. Who wants to be with something or someone like that? It&#39;s more fun to be with someone who is willing to go out on a limb.&#34; This book is designed by Owens herself, and accompanies an exhibition at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. Along with paintings from the show, it includes new drawings made exclusively for the publication, as well as several textile works from the museum&#39;s collection that inspired her during her residency of Spring 2000.</p><p>This expansive overview of Laura Owens&#x2019;s career offers unique insights into the influences and sources behind the pioneering and unconventional work of one of today&#x2019;s most influential artists.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;Laura Owens was born in Ohio in 1970. Since her first solo exhibitions in the mid-90s at Gavin Brown&#39;s Enterprise in New York and the Rosamund Felsen Gallery in Santa Monica, she has exhibited widely and in 2001 she had her first solo museum exhibition at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.

He studied History at Liverpool and Oxford Universities and obtained a doctorate for his thesis on Edward II and Queen Isabella. He is now headmaster of a school in north-east London and lives with his family in Essex.When Hugh Corbett, legal adviser and clerk to the Chancellor of England, is sent to Scotland in the wretchedly cold spring of 1286 to investigate the death of King Alexander III, he is met with hostility, suspicion and murderous rage. Did King Alexander dash off on a furiously stormy night to visit his young French bride and accidentally plunge from a cliff to his death below? Or perhaps his fall was the result of scheming and plotting by ambitious nobles, including the power-hungry Robert Bruce. When the careful and secretive Corbett begins asking pointed questions he is arrested on a trumped-up charge of treason and murder; after his release he is the target of assassination attempts. He begins to make progress in his quest only when he joins forces with Bishop Wishart of Glasgow. Doherty (The Death of a King) brings the harsh medieval landscape of Scotland to vivid life, particularly its gritty and malodorous cities, its wildly beautiful countryside and its population of devout, enigmatic or sinister characters. Yet, a superfluity of historical explanations and far too much laborious speculation on Corbett's part slow the book's pace to a quiet crawl. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Emigrants from Ireland, 1847-1852 State-Aided Emigration Schemes from Crown</h2><p>Between 1847 and 1852, a number of Irish small-holders, assisted by the government, emigrated from the Crown estates of Ballykileline in Co.

Success did not come easy for him; at both Notre Dame and San Francisco he had to compete for the starting job. On the whole, this book is disappointing: a rambling, uncohesive account of his unhappy years at Notre Dame and his success with the 49ers. Montana is at his best when he drops game-by-game details and focuses on subjects important to himhis family, the abuses of sports journalists, and why he is not a member of the NFL Players Association and did not support the 1982 strike. It comes as a shock to learn that Montana is a quiet introvert and that he is not allowed to fully use his quarterback talents, since head coach Bill Walsh calls all of the plays. Nevertheless, Montana and the 49ers are popular, and this book should be in demand. Jo DeLapo, Queens Borough P.L., New York<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Devotees of Montana and the San Francisco '49ers will enjoy this autobiography, written with the aid of TV Guide sportscribe Raissman, but it is unlikely to have much wider appeal. Montana is a product of western Pennsylvania, where he starred in high school before going on to Notre Dame. He had a struggle before winning the spot as top signal-caller for the Fighting Irish and did not always get along well with his coach, Dan Devine. He moved to the 49ers and led the team to two Super Bowl victories, again not enjoying a warm relationship with his coach. But essentially, his life has been a smooth progression up the ladder, with two failed marriages as the only major setbacks. His career simply has not been the sort that makes for an exciting sports bio.

Further rarifying its in-joke status was its unapologetic Englishness; 13 tracks stitched together in a mock pirate radio broadcast, without a DJ, with cool, anglocentric commercials to boot. In the 36 years since its release, <i>Sell Out</i>, though still not the best selling release in The Who's catalog, has been embraced by a growing number of fans who regard it as the band's best work, one of the few recordings of the late 1960s that best represents the ambitious aesthetic possibilities of the concept album without becoming mired in a bog of smug, self-aggrandizing, high art aspirations. <i>Sell Out</i>, powerfully and ecstatically, articulates the nexus of pop music and pop culture.</p><p>As much as it is an expression of the band's expanding sonic palette, <i>Sell Out</i> also functions as a critique of the rock and roll lifestyle. Not the clich�d mantra of sex, drugs, and rock and roll but in the ways that commercial advertising fabricates a youth-oriented cultural reality by hawking pimple cream, deodorant, food, musical equipment, etc., and linking it with rock and roll. In this sense <i>Sell Out</i> is a reflective work, one that struggles with rock and roll as a cultural expression that aspires to aesthetic permanence while marketed as ephemera. From this conflict emerges a pop art masterpiece.</p></p><p>John Dougan received a Ph.D. in American Studies from the College of William &amp; Mary and is an associate professor in the Department of Recording Industry at Middle Tennessee State University.The concept behind <i>Sell Out</i> &#x2013; a collection of Who songs tied together with fake advertising and real promotional jingles simulating a pirate radio broadcast from offshore station Radio London &#x2013; along with being timely and brilliant, indicated that significant cultural changes were in the offing. Not the least of which was the reality that the BBC, a corporation whose interest in youth culture was marked by diffidence and condescension, would again control British pop music radio. As for the Who, <i>Sell Out</i> signaled the beginning of the end of their career as a pop band, and spectacularly announced their transition into a world-conquering rock band, a metamorphosis made complete with the release of <i>Tommy</i> in 1969.</p><h2>Walk in My Soul</h2><p>Tiana was a Cherokee woman.

Death is merely the beginning of Chaim&#x2019;s troubles. In the opening pages, he is shot along with the other Jews of his small Polish village. But instead of resting peacefully in the World to Come, Chaim, for reasons unclear to him, is left to wander the earth, accompanied by his rabbi, who has taken the form of a talking crow. Chaim&#x2019;s afterlife journey is filled with extraordinary encounters whose consequences are far greater than he realizes. <br><br> Not since art Spiegelman&#x2019;s <i>Maus</i> has a work so powerfully evoked one of the darkest moments of the twentieth century with such daring originality.</p><p>Chaim Skibelski rises from a pit of slaughter, leaving his dead townsmen and family behind, and returns to his home--now occupied by non-Jews. "In front of every house were piles of vows and promises, all in broken pieces. How I could see such things," he wonders, "I cannot tell you." So begins this magic-realist fiction, which is also a keen allegory of European Jews' war and postwar experience. "You think they can't kill us as often as they wish?" the narrator cries, and his distrust seems right. Though Chaim and the Rebbe are the only ones to have escaped the sudden roundup, they too, it soon becomes clear, are dead. The Rebbe has been transformed into a crow while Chaim's body seeps with blood and half of his face is missing. But if he's dead, why isn't he in the World to Come and why can some Poles and one German soldier see and hear him? <p> In his first novel, Joseph Skibell has created a fantasia both hideous and beautiful, a combination of mysticism, nightmare, and even humor. After Chaim and the Rebbe dig up other putrefied victims, the sorry, brave group moves painfully away from the village. Freezing days pass, perhaps years. "If you were the Rebbe, floating high above us, what you would see would be a great river of blood cutting a swath through the frozen winter hills." The author anatomizes the pilgrims' differences, cultural and religious, with love and wit. They are disputatious even in death--their debates threatening to overwhelm what holds them together. Though the phrase <i>tour de force</i> has been much abused, <i>A Blessing on the Moon</i> is exactly that: a daring fiction that shouldn't succeed on any level yet works on many.</p>Recommended Reading from Joseph Skibell - So many important Jewish books are now available in English, paring down a list to recommend was not an easy task. But here are a few remarkable books of stories, philosophy, and history from the Jewish tradition: <p><i>In Praise of the Baal Shem Tov</i>, translated and edited by Dan Ben-Amos and Jerome R. Mintz, and <i>Meeting With Remarkable Souls: Legends of the Baal Shem Tov</i>, by Eliahu Klein, are two collections of stories, one classic, the other contemporary, about Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer (1700-1760) or the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism. A master of dreams, healing, and heavenly ascension, the Baal Shem Tov, thought to be a simple beadle until he revealed himself to be an extraordinary teacher at age thirty-six, changed the face of Judaism through his assumption-challenging acts and philosophies. </p><p><i>Nine Gates to the Chasidic Mysteries</i>, by Jiri Langer. In 1913, the nineteen-year-old Langer, a friend of Franz Kafka's (he taught Kafka Hebrew), left his assimilated family in Prague to live among the Hasidim of Belz in Galicia. Long after his return, he composed this delightful collection of tales about a luminous handful of Rebbes and their Hasidim. (One of my favorites concerns Moyshe Wolf, a pious Jew, who sues God before a Rabbinic court--and wins!) Classified as a "monstrosity of art," the book was burned by the Nazi occupiers eighteen months after its publication. </p><p>Other excellent story collections include a quartet of books by Howard Schwartz: <i>Elijah's Violin and Other Jewish Fairy Tales</i>, <i>Miriam's Tambourine: Jewish Tales From Around the World</i>, <i>Lilith's Cave: Jewish Tales of the Supernatural</i>, and <i>Gabriel's Palace: Jewish Mystical Tales</i>. These two-hundred-plus tales come from all sorts of sources and from all over the world, and Schwartz retells them with beguiling simplicity and panache. </p><p><i>To Heal the Soul: The Spiritual Journal of a Chasidic Rebbe</i>, by Kalonymus Kalman Shapira, translated and edited by Yehoshua Starrett. A remarkable and inspiring document. Parts of Rebbe Kalonymus Kalman Shapira's journal were composed inside the Warsaw Ghetto. In 1943 he placed his manuscripts in a tin container and buried them in the ground beneath the Ghetto, where they were found after the war. An account of a remarkable soul's encounter with his Creator, the journal also outlines, in a simple and straightforward style, meditative and other techniques for mastering one's life, clearing one's mind, and putting one's yearning and remorse into action. The Holy Rebbe died in Treblinka on November 2, 1943. </p><p><i>Shivitti: A Vision</i>, by Ka-Tzetnik 135633. Yehiel De-Nur signs the accounts of his years in Auschwitz with the number the Nazis tattooed onto his arm. In this memoir, De-Nur undergoes LSD therapy in Holland in the mid-'70s as a treatment for the lingering torments classified as "Concentration Camp Syndrome." This small book--wild, anguished, hallucinatory--is a shattering experience filled with De-Nur's precise descriptions of his inner world, the remembered horror of the camps, and the visions induced by his therapy. </p><p><i>The Place Where You Are Standing is Holy: A Jewish Theology on Human Relationships</i>, by Gershon Winkler with Lakme Batya Elior. A deep reexamination of the covenantal aspect of relationships (with God, self, other, our children, and the earth) in the light of rich texts from the Talmud, Midrash, and mystical teachings of Judaism by a contemporary rabbi working within the Jewish Renewal movement and his partner, a psychotherapist. A doorway into the wisdom, grace, and beauty of the Jewish path of heart, the book is a practical, down-to-earth, and inexhaustible guide for conscious living. </p><p><i>Jewish Views of the Afterlife</i>, by Simcha Paull Raphael. This highly readable, scholarly overview traces the unfolding history of the Jewish conception of the afterlife from the earliest writings on. Raphael includes a practical guide for anyone facing the death of a loved one. </p><p><i>9 1/2 Mystics: the Kabbala Today</i>, by Herbert Weiner, is a rollicking first-person account of an American rabbi's sojourn through the secret and revealed paths of Jewish mysticism, right at the dawning of the Age of Aquarius.

Kennedy Summer 1945</h2><p>Newly discovered diary of a young JFK.</p><p>As World War II was ending and the cold war was just beginning, a twenty-eight-year-old naval hero, decommissioned before war&#39;s end because of his crippling injuries, traveled through a devastated Europe. During that trip, John F. Kennedy kept a diary, never before published and until now unknown - even to Kennedy scholars. As the diary makes clear, that European trip was a turning point in the future President&#39;s life. The scion of one of America&#39;s wealthiest families, Jack Kennedy had grown up in the shadow of an adored older brother destined for greatness. For himself, Jack had intended a quiet career as a college professor or perhaps as an author. But when Joe Kennedy, Jr. was killed in the skies over the English Channel, the expectations of his family and the mantle of leadership passed on to JFK. Would he accept them? That was the question that confronted Kennedy as he traveled in the company of cabinet secretaries and generals, future presidents and prime ministers, toured a humbled Germany, and faced for the first time the power of post-war Russia and the perfidy and bloody-mindedness of Communists in power. It was on this trip, the diary shows, that Kennedy first confronted the &#34;long twilight struggle&#34; for the preservation of Western freedom that would define his Presidency. In these few months an agenda for a Presidency began to be forged. For as the closing pages of the diary make clear, it was at this time that the challenge was accepted, the mantle taken up, and Kennedy began laying plans for his first run for Congress, the first step in his journey to the White House. Prelude to Leadership offers, as Hugh Sidey says in his Introduction, an &#34;intriguing new trove&#34; of insightinto the mind of a future president preparing himself for a &#34;still distant challenge&#34;. It reveals a man who, not yet thirty, understood not only that a new world drama was taking shape, but that he was destined to play a great role in it.<b>Deirdre Henderson</b> was a research assistant to Senator John F.

On her time travels, she meets two children who are desperately in need of help and she encounters danger and excitement in her bid to rescue them.</p><p>Grade 5-8 From the very first pages, the mood of mystery/time travel fantasy is well-developed. When Minty is left at Aunt Mary's for a summer visit, she discovers cold spots on a hot July day and mysterious graves, and she hears crying children calling out to her. Then her mother is injured in an auto accident and falls into a deep coma. Minty seeks refuge from the reality of her mother's illness through her fascination with two poor and abused children from the past whom she meets through the help of a moondial. Readers will fear for Minty as she encounters ghosts; deals with a belligerent mob of superstitious, menacing children bent on attacking a poor birth-mark scarred child; and tries to fight off adults who beat a poor kitchen-boy living in 1871. This is a dark story of the battle of love over fear, a fight with a witch who does the devil's work, a story that ends on a long-ago Halloween night. Although this borders on morbid, the theme of ``Light and Shadow by turns, but always Love,'' saves it from a melancholy tone. There are not enough Briticisms to deter readers from finishing this exciting mystery steeped in the mysticism of moon and star time. The idea that Minty's mother, kept alive by sighing machines, is a refugee from time who is kept alive by her daughter's story of a time-riddle is a fascinating new plot.

Hoping to release her mother from the spell of a coma, Minty tells her the story of the rescue of Tom and Sarah in cliff-hanging installations.

Burnett</i><p><i>Anderson</i><i> University</i></p>v (<i>Religious Studies Review</i>)</p><h2>Burmese Days</h2><p>Set in the days of the Empire, with the British ruling in Burma, this book describes corruption and imperial bigotry. Flory, a white timber merchant, befriends Dr Veraswami, a black enthusiast for the Empire, whose downfall can only be prevented by membership at an all-white club.</p><p>Imagine crossing E.M. Forster with Jane Austen. Stir in a bit of socialist doctrine, a sprig of satire, strong Indian curry, and a couple quarts of good English gin and you get something close to the flavor of George Orwell's intensely readable and deftly plotted <i>Burmese Days</i>. In 1930, Kyauktada, Upper Burma, is one of the least auspicious postings in the ailing British Empire--and then the order comes that the European Club, previously for whites only, must elect one token native member. This edict brings out the worst in this woefully enclosed society, not to mention among the natives who would become the One. Orwell mines his own Anglo-Indian background to evoke both the suffocating heat and the stifling pettiness that are the central facts of colonial life: "Mr. MacGregor told his anecdote about Prome, which could be produced in almost any context. And then the conversation veered back to the old, never-palling subject--the insolence of the natives, the supineness of the Government, the dear dead days when the British Raj <i>was</i> the Raj and please give the bearer fifteen lashes. The topic was never let alone for long, partly because of Ellis's obsession. Besides, you could forgive the Europeans a great deal of their bitterness. Living and working among Orientals would try the temper of a saint."<p> Protagonist James Flory is a timber merchant, whose facial birthmark serves as an outward expression of the ironic and left-leaning habits of mind that make him inwardly different from his coevals. Flory appreciates the local culture, has native allegiances, and detests the racist machinations of his fellow Club members. Alas, he doesn't always possess the moral courage, or the energy, to stand against them. His almost embarrassingly Anglophile friend, Dr. Veraswami, the highest-ranking native official, seems a shoo-in for Club membership, until Machiavellian magistrate U Po Kyin launches a campaign to discredit him that results, ultimately, in the loss not just of reputations but of lives. Whether to endorse Veraswami or to betray him becomes a kind of litmus test of Flory's character.</p><p> Against this backdrop of politics and ethics, Orwell throws the shadow of romance. The arrival of the bobbed blonde, marriageable, and resolutely anti-intellectual Elizabeth Lackersteen not only casts Flory as hapless suitor but gives Orwell the chance to show that he's as astute a reporter of nuanced social interactions as he is of political intrigues. In fact, his combination of an astringently populist sensibility, dead-on observations of human behavior, formidable conjuring skills, and no-frills prose make for historical fiction that stands triumphantly outside of time. <i>--Joyce Thompson</i></p>In this caustic, fast-paced novel about the waning days of British imperialism, George Orwell draws on his years of experience in India, the country of his birth. The story focuses on a handful of Englishmen living in a small settlement in Upper Burma. They congregate in the European Club, drinking whiskey and arguing over an impending order to admit a token Asian.</p><h2>The Incredible Voyage: A Personal Odyssey</h2><p>In a salty, slashing style, Tristan Jones unfolds his extraordinary saga--a six year voyage during which he a covered a distance equal to twice the circumference of the world--revealing both a rich sense of history an insuppressible Welsh wit.<br><br>With a singleness of purpose as ferocious as nay hazard he encountered, Tristan Jones would not give up--even after dodging snipers on the Red Sea, capsizing off the Cape of Good Hope, starving in the Amazon, struggling for 3,000 miles against the mightiest sea current in the world, and hauling his boat over the rugged Andes three miles above sea level to find at last the legendary Island of the Sun. And beyond lay te most awesome challenge of all--the tortuous trek through 6,000 miles of uncharted rivers to find his way back to the ocean.</p><p>Tristan Jones was one of the most prolific and best-loved authors of sailing stories. A Welshman, he left school at age 14 to work on sailing barges and spent the rest of his life at sea--in the Royal Navy, as a delivery skipper, and as a daring adventurer in search of new seagoing challenges. Jones wrote 16 books, including Encounters of a Wayward Sailor published by Sheridan House....well-told, embellished not only with hyperbole and idiosyncratic opinion, but with history, philosophy, even poetry....Romance is another word I would use: love of the sea, adventure, excitement, and he our errant knight, a direct descendant of Captain Ahab and Joshua Slocum. This gripping sea yarn is at once a riveting adventure story and a testament to human tenacity. In a salty, slashing style, he unfolds his extraordinary saga, revealing both a rich sense of history and an insuppressible Welsh wit.

The year is 1699 and Joseph is now in Alta California, to imitate an ancient Native-American Coyote god, and save the native Chumash from the white Europeans.He has the help of the Botanist Mendoza, who hasn't gotten over the death of her lover Nicholas, in Elizabethan England. </p><p>Lately though, Joseph has started to have a few doubts about The Company. There are whispers about the year 2355, about operatives that suddenly go missing. Time is running out for Joseph, which is ironic considering he's immortal, but no one ever said that it was easy being a god.</p></p><p>Kage Baker's first novel, <i>In the Garden of Iden</i>, was a smart, funny, top-drawer read. Fans will be happy to find out that Baker avoids a sophomore slump with <i>Sky Coyote</i>, the second novel of the Company, and another superbly witty and intelligent book. Baker switches focus in this sequel to Joseph, the immortal cyborg who rescued <i>Iden</i>'s heroine, Mendoza, from the dungeons of the Spanish Inquisition. Joseph and Mendoza work for Dr. Zeus, otherwise known as the Company, a 24th-century operation devoted to getting rich off the past. To accomplish this, the Company turns orphans and refugees from the past into super-smart, nigh invincible cyborgs and sends them on missions to save or hide precious paintings, cultural treasures, and genetic information useful to the future world.<p> <i>Sky Coyote</i> begins in pre-Columbian Mexico, where Joseph and Mendoza are reunited at New World One, an extravagant Company retreat. When European explorers are scheduled to arrive in the New World, the Company dismantles operations, and Joseph is sent to California in 1699 to save a Chumash village lock, stock, and barrel, before Europeans arrive with smallpox and slavery. To prep the Native Americans for their voyage to a Company enclave in Australia, Joseph poses as Uncle Sky Coyote, a trickster-god of the Chumash, and tells them he's there to save them from certain doom at the hands of white men. But can Joseph convince the wary, savvy Chumash labor unions, lodges, and entrepreneurs that he has their best interests at heart, all without screwing up history? And will he patch things up with Mendoza, who still hasn't forgiven him for everything that happened in 1500s England?

This book presents an in-depth exploration of this issue in a novel format, by presenting a celebrated piece on this issue by Raimundo Panikkar, with a detailed response to it by Arvind Sharma, thereby laying bare several key dimensions of the debate which may otherwise escape notice.</p><p></p><h2>Forest Dreams, Forest Nightmares: The Paradox of Old Growth in the Inland West (Weyerhaeuser Environmental Books)</h2><p>Across the inland West, forests that once seemed like paradise have turned into an ecological nightmare. Fires, insect epidemics, and disease now threaten millions of acres of once-bountiful forests. Yet no one can agree what went wrong. Was it too much management&#x2015;or not enough&#x2015;that forced the forests of the inland West to the verge of collapse? Is the solution more logging, or no logging at all? In this gripping work of scientific and historical detection, Nancy Langston unravels the disturbing history of what went wrong with the western forests, despite the best intentions of those involved.<br><br>Focusing on the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon and southeastern Washington, she explores how the complex landscapes that so impressed settlers in the nineteenth century became an ecological disaster in the late twentieth. Federal foresters, intent on using their scientific training to stop exploitation and waste, suppressed light fires in the ponderosa pinelands. Hoping to save the forests, they could not foresee that their policies would instead destroy what they loved. When light fires were kept out, a series of ecological changes began. Firs grew thickly in forests once dominated by ponderosa pines, and when droughts hit, those firs succumbed to insects, diseases, and eventually catastrophic fires.<br><br>Nancy Langston combines remarkable skills as both scientist and writer of history to tell this story. Her ability to understand and bring to life the complex biological processes of the forest is matched by her grasp of the human forces at work&#x2015;from Indians, white settlers, missionaries, fur trappers, cattle ranchers, sheep herders, and railroad builders to timber industry and federal forestry managers.<br><br>The book will be of interest to a wide audience of environmentalists, historians, ecologists, foresters, ranchers, and loggers&#x2015;and all people who want to understand the changing lands of the West.</p><p>Nancy Langston is assistant professor of environmental studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.Langston, an ecologist and assistant professor of environmental studies at the University of Wisconsin, presents a history and analysis of forest management in the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon and Washington. Beginnning her story before the arrival of whites, she reminds us that although we think of the land as "wild" and "natural" before our arrival, in fact the Natives had been changing it for thousands of years to suit their own needs. She chronicles U.S. Forest Service management, and mismanagement, from the beginning of the 20th century yet advises that this is a story without villains or heroes. Langston contends that the situation is more complicated than represented by either environmentalists or traditional foresters. She suggests that we find a way to let the natural constraints of a place shape our efforts toward it, so that we work with the land rather than trying to play God with it.

He had hoped to spend time with his mother and old friends. Instead, he finds himself caught up in the cases of two people who claim to have been sexually abused by an eminent Sydney cleric - one the son of Docherty's former parishioner, the other a former nun. And the cleric in question is brother to the woman Docherty fell in love with many years before. If the accusations are true, the consequences for many will be devastating, but Docherty has to follow his conscience.<br> <br> In this riveting, profoundly thoughtful novel, Thomas Keneally draws on his own experience as an ex-seminarian to bring alive matters of faith, celibacy, perversion and marriage. Portraying the Catholic Church at a pivotal moment, he shows that its prevarications and cover-ups wreaked terrible damage not only on innocents but on itself, with toxic repercussions to this day.</p><p>The force and resonance of the issue in question - together with Keneally's wise and thoughtful treatment of it - make for another hugely satisfying read from one of the world's great writers. (James Walton <i>Spectator</i>)<br><br>A provocative and powerful study of abusers and the abused. It captures the honourable priests determined to expose the outrage and the church hierarchy equally determined to discredit them. Most poignantly, it depicts ordinary Catholics caught in the crossfire . . . The writing is most powerful when it conveys the raw pain of the victims and the twisted psyches of their abusers . . . Above all, Keneally exposes the cynical casuistry of a church determined to fight critics down to "its last lawyer", an institution that puts its survival above its soul. (Michael Arditti <i>Guardian</i>)<br><br>Characteristically brave and unflinching . . .Keneally's theme is sadly familiar, but in the hands of a world-renowned writer - still, on this evidence, at the height of his powers, and with a long record of shining a light on human frailty and injustice - <i>Crimes of the Father</i> goes way beyond the familiar. It questions what makes a good priest and, therefore, what makes a bad one. And that, Keneally concludes, isn't only to do with individual make-up, circumstances or choices, but also down to institutional Catholicism and "emotional dwarfism" . (Peter Stanford <i>Observer</i>)<br><br>A compelling novel . . . One of the strengths of the novel is Keneally's depiction of the abuser. A chilling portrait is drawn of a man who despises his own actions . . . but who nevertheless seems incapable of stopping. The scenes between him and Docherty, who has uncovered the truth, are compulsive . . . Keneally is one of the great chroniclers of his country's history . . . Here he recognises the injustices done to his fellow countrymen and women by an uncaring establishment . . . to the growing body of work devoted to this most dispiriting of subject, <i>Crimes of the Father </i>is a welcome addition, not least for the dignity that Keneally lends to the good priest's voice as well as to those of the victims of abuse. (John Boyne <i>Irish Times</i>)<br><br>A convincing argument for the power of fiction to get under the skin of a great contemporary controversy. (James Marriott <i>The Times</i>)<br><br><p>The divine alchemy of Thomas Keneally is to take something real and make it truer still . . .<br>Docherty is a powerful creation . . . Keneally explores the human condition almost forensically, though with an uplifting charity . . . he is extraordinarily perceptive on the pain of both the victims and those in the Church who have watched these scandals unfold with horror . . . the novel points to the pain of those who trusted and who were abused, those who gave faith and were rewarded in the coin of unspeakable criminality. It also offers the merest glint of optimism.</p> (Hugh MacDonald <i>The Herald</i>)<br><br>Pulsing with rage at ecclesiastical complacency, it's a deeply discomfiting (but never prurient) quest for redress, narrated with clarity and urgency. (Anthony Cummins <i>Daily Mail</i>)<br><br>Keneally is a superb writer who tackles a complex subject calmly but incisively, creating a compelling read. (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><i>Crimes of the Father </i>has something of the feel of John Grisham's courtroom thrillers . . . It is not an easy read, but nor should it be . . . it is a worthwhile attempt to explore how a devoted priest with a clear understanding of humanity can if not atone for, then at least fully address, the crimes of others. (Matt Thorne <i>Catholic Herald</i>)<br><br>Keneally's fiction has returned again and again to the themes of thwarted justice and human opportunism.

Piles of blond hair, a 39-inch bosom and a genius for self-promotion gave visibility, if not credence, to her claims to be "Queen of the Night," "a contemporary Sex Goddess" and "the babe who's everywhere." Now, in this how-to book, Brill wannabes can learn how to dress like her, flirt like her, push their breasts into shapes like hers, even self-promote like her. If there were a hint of the author's tongue being in her cheek, this book would be a laugh-out-loud satirical riot. Unfortunately, Brill is dead serious. For her, the only reality is what other people think of you; her shallow advice is a particularly revolting manifestation of the "you look marvelous" philosophy that formed the personal counterpart to Wall Street's "greed is good" business credo. Brill seems to have missed the fact that the 1980s are over and the junk bond market has collapsed--or maybe she's just hoping that no such calamity befalls the junk book market. Caveat emptor.

That said, an introductory reference and overview is equally likely essential. Angus Clark has drawn from his broad experience and deep understanding of the history, forms, and practical benefits of this art in crafting this lovely book. The book begins with a very helpful historical perspective of Tai Chi and articulates well its relationship to other Chinese martial arts. The presentation of the Short Form (a variation of the Cheng Man-Ch&#39;ing short form) is quite well done with additional material on useful variations. Throughout the book the breadth of Tai Chi&#39;s value is constantly reinforced. From relaxation and exercise, through general health and fitness, to defense and martial forms, Clark nicely opens the door to the cosmos of Tai Chi. Of particular value are a collection of short notes from Westerners who have taken up this art for a variety of reason and for varying lengths of time. I found these particularly encouraging. As a newcomer to Tai Chi, I will be supplementing this book with videos and probably local courses. Clark&#39;s work is superbly supported with that of the numerous talented illustrators. The result is a lovely book to enjoy, share, and reread often.</p><p></p><h2>Heaven&#39;s Coast: A Memoir</h2><p>A poet who won the National Book Critic&#39;s Circle Award shares the story of his relationship with lover Wally Roberts, who died of AIDS in 1993, recounting the effect the disease had on their lives and the aftermath of Wally&#39;s death. National ad/promo. Tour.</p><p><p>Mark Doty's books of poetry and nonfiction prose have been honored with numerous distinctions, including the National Book Critics Circle Award, the PEN/Martha Albrand Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and, in the United Kingdom, the T. S. Eliot Prize. In 2008, he won the National Book Award for <em>Fire to Fire: New and Selected Poems</em>. He is a professor at the University of Houston, and he lives in New York City. </p>Asking, ``What does a writer do, when the world collapses, but write?,'' Doty, whose world collapsed when his lover died, gives an answer that's both generous and indulgent. In a look back at the period before, during, and after Wally Roberts succumbed to complications of AIDS, the author (a winner of the National Book Critics Circle award for poetry) walks a path between the practical and the poetic, the enraged and the calm. On one hand, he's got helpful observations for support partners--``The lower one goes in the medical system, it seems, the more humanity, the more hands-on help, the more genuine care.'' On the other, he's ready to turn profound on death's many approaching moments, especially its final one--``. . . he is most himself, even if that self empties out into no one, swift river hurrying into the tumble of rivers, out of individuality, into the great rushing whirlwind of currents.'' Putting the puzzle of his life back together after Roberts's demise upset it, Doty returns to the Boston house where the proud and very out pair first lived together (but in separate apartments); recalls the Vermont homes they shared; and fills in the final Provincetown years. He visits landscapes here and abroad, finding reminders--and metaphors and avatars--of their relationship wherever he looks. He also writes with love about the friends who filled the couple's days with joy and anxiety (a self-destructive poet identified only as Lynda particularly delights and infuriates Doty). He commemorates Arden and Beau, two rollicking dogs who kept things much happier than they might otherwise have been. A poet with a quick memory for poems he didn't write, Doty is angry at the realities of the world when it unleashes physical and moral diseases, and grateful when it shows a kinder face. A book very much like grief itself in that it's sometimes awkward, often uncontrolled, and always deeply felt. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Her own experiences spanning three decades as both an activist and observer undergird her analysis in riveting ways. We see her in a stadium filled with Promise Keepers, watching thousands of men pledge in unison to take control of their families, with a mixture of awe, fear, and a lucid understanding of what draws people to such charismatic events. <br><br>"If you have time for only one book about the ultra-conservative resurgence, this is it."&#x2014;*Gloria Steinem <br><br>"A thoughtful and provocative look at the right wing in the United States, replacing simple condemnation with sober analysis. It raises the troubling question: what can we learn from people we fear."&#x2014;Howard Zinn, author of A People's History of the United States <br><br>"Mobilizing Resentment provides a wealth of information for anyone interested in how to refocus the energy and idealism of the progressive movement on the building of institutions that are relevant to the lives of most Americans."&#x2014;Wilma Mankiller, from the Foreword</p><p>Jean Hardisty is founder and executive director of Political Research Associates. She lives in Somerville, Massachusetts.In this surprisingly uninformative study of right-wing politics, Hardisty attempts to explain the ascendance of what she calls the New Right, that awkward marriage of libertarianism with social conservatism exemplified by the cooperation between Newt Gingrich and the Christian Coalition. She traces the seeds of the New Right's success back to the early 1970s, when strategists such as Jerry Falwell began to politicize conservative white Christians. Her theoretical discussions are strong, especially when she dissects the various flavors of libertarianism, but she fails to link those ideological concerns meaningfully to real-world politics. The founder and executive director of Political Research Associates, an organization that monitors right-wing politics, Hardisty makes no bones about her own political opinions, which reside far to the left of the spectrum. In the end, she is less concerned with understanding political conservatism than with exhorting progressives to strengthen their arguments in order to win the allegiance of those now being courted and won over by the right. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, and progressive activists will find some of her advice well worth heeding. But readers looking for an authoritative analysis of American political conservatism won't find it here. Worse, though Hardisty tries to see the "human" element of conservative social and political movements, she still exhibits a classic form of liberal contempt. It's one thing to disagree passionately with conservatism, quite another to view the New Right as something intrinsically undemocratic rather than as a wholly legitimate part of democracy's clamorous existence.

With a remarkable combination of tenderness, wicked humor, and biting satire, the main character, Ella-or "She"-moves toward establishing her sexual identity (she has affairs with both men and women) and finding her rightful place in the world while simultaneously raising her son to be independent and self-sufficient.</p><p>Reminiscent of the picaresque novel, <i>Watercolor Women / Opaque Men </i>contains episodes that range from the Mexican Revolution to modern-day Chicago and reflects a deep pride in Chicano culture and the hardships immigrants had to endure: "In my familia we don't / pretend. / We're not / Mixed blood. There are no buried / Spanish titles beneath /anyone's tombstone." Nor does Castillo tolerate the pretensions of others. Pomposity, arrogance, and narrow-mindedness are the targets of her satiric pen.</p><p>In a strong rhythmic and colloquial voice, Castillo explores these issues of love, sexual orientation, and cultural identity, taking to heart the words of Mama Grande: "You will always be your most reliable resource."</p></p><p>&nbsp;<p>Ana Castillo is indisputably one of the most important Chicana authors writing today. &nbsp;She has written 17 books, the most noted being <i>Peel My Love like an Onion</i> and <i>So Far from God</i>. Born in Chicago of working-class parents, she went on to earn a PhD in American studies at the University of Chicago. Both as a journalist and literary author, she has been a major force in the struggle for economic justice, women's rights, and civil liberties. She has also won numerous awards, including the American Book Award, the Carl Sandburg Award, and the Mountains &amp; Plains Booksellers Award. At present, she lives in Anthony, New Mexico.</p>It's a bold or a foolish decision to write a novel in verse. Few enough people pick up novels; fewer still read poetry in any form. Combine the two, and you risk sacrificing the propulsive possibilities of narrative prose to the elliptical insights of verse. Who'd trade a robust narrative and well-fleshed-out characters for a handful of lyrical moments?<p>You don't really have to in Watercolor Women/Opaque Men, Ana Castillo's new novel in verse, although its hybrid literary form tries to contain more multitudes -- of characters, historical and mythological episodes and socio-political commentary -- than it has room for. Like Castillo's previous books, Peel My Love Like an Onion and So Far From God, this one centers on the lives and loves of Latino women -- in this case one woman, the archetypal Ella. She was born to Mexican workers who came to the United States for "la pizca" -- "the picking they did/ season after season" in the growing fields that, for people like them, have also been killing fields.</p><p>Castillo writes feelingly of those who work themselves to death, the children like Ella forced to toil alongside their too-soon-old parents:</p><p>Forget</p><p>The sun that caused fevers,<br>blistered lips and feet,<br>made you see spots for years after,</p><p>Forget<br>the beans we had for supper again,<br>the last baby that died soon after birth,</p><p>The t�o suffering of tuberculosis<br>when each morning he rose with the rest, coughing, coughing.</p><p>Ella doesn't forget, though. She doesn't forget her parents, happy together in their short, hard lives. She doesn't forget her great-grandmother, Mama Grande, and her tales of the Mexican Revolution:</p><p>"I made my living in a saloon after that.<br>We danced with the Federales,<br>Los Carranzistas, Villistas, Colorados.</p><p>"We danced with Zapatistas,<br>Ay, you know, hija?<br>It didn't matter."</p><p>Ella discovers, however, that it -- your politics, your sexual orientation, the color of your skin -- does matter in a world where "Righteous White Boyz" take brown-skinned lovers because "they loved the idea of la otra -- / dark woman as primal symbol of true courage/ and indomitable strength."</p><p>Ella runs away from fields and family. She marries young, has a kid, has an affair with a woman, leaves her husband, has other affairs with men and women, supports herself and her son cleaning offices and doing whatever else she has to do. These episodes play out, each episode recalled or evoked, in three-line stanzas that land like perfect little revelations of truth -- "You can forget everything/ about your life/ when you ride the train" -- or wander off into thickets of myth that leave the reader peering around for some sort of authorial direction back to the story:</p><p>She fits now and belongs to nowhere --<br>ella, who the devil left for dead.<br>She and I sleep together,<br>Whether on sacks of wheat or a proper bed.<br>We sleep the sleep of Xochiquetzal<br>in Tamoanchan</p><p>Who is all flowers and song,<br>and dreams of her Rain God.<br>Tlaloc, furiously calling.</p><p>Aztec gods, got it -- now where?</p><p>Despite Ella's understandable rage at those "Righteous White Boyz" who see in her an archetype of primal strength, she (or her creator) feels free to indulge in stereotypes of her own. The white lovers she takes are far from opaque: They're transparent caricatures (patronizing, uptight, ashamed), while the Mexican Indian amor shines as a model of humble, earthy virtue and devotion. And the political asides about the plight of migrant workers and the heartlessness of American life feel just as stale as they are true, although in these times certain truths about power and oppression bear repeating. Ella herself is a pillar of strength, a -- to use a word that now feels as old as any Aztec god but far less interesting -- survivor. She may paint in watercolor -- one of the references embedded in the book's title -- but she's not going to wash away. Still, it's hard to see Ella sometimes behind those three-line stanzas, and hard not to wonder whether she'd have been less of a watercolor if she came to us via prose. Is the obliquity of verse Castillo's attempt to recreate in words the experience of being brown-skinned in a culture that makes too many assumptions about identity without bothering to find out about the person under the skin?

But her friends miss her so much that they can't bear to obey her orders&#x2014;and they turn Brownie's &#x201c;do not disturb&#x201d; into a comic commotion, complete with a stunningly beautiful nighttime surprise. Susan Blackaby has created a fun romp filled with delightful wordplay, enhanced by Carmen Segovia's illustrations featuring splashes of color against a snowy backdrop. <br>&nbsp;</p><p><p>Susan Blackaby's first picture book, <i>Rembrandt's Hat</i> (Houghton Mifflin) was praised by <i>Publishers Weekly</i> as a &#x201c;satisfyingly spontaneous and quirky tale . . . simply 'fedorable.'&#x201d; Susan is also the author of <i>Sterling Biographies�: Cleopatra</i>&#x2014;which &#x201c;leaves readers fascinated and eager to learn more&#x201d; (<i>School Library Journal</i>)-and a poetry collection, <i>Nest, Nook, and Cranny (</i>Charlesbridge Publishing). Susan lives in Portland, OR. </p><p>Carmen Segovia is an award-winning illustrator who lives in Barcelona, Spain. One winter, she chose to sketch a little groundhog that wakes before spring and passes the time by sliding down a snowy hill, and building a &#x201c;snow friend.&#x201d; The paintings were selected for the Bologna Children's Book Fair Illustrators Exhibition where Carmen's American editor became determined to create a book starring the groundhog. Carmen's first picture book in the US was <i>China Doll</i> (Sterling) by Elza Pilgrim.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;K-Gr 2&#x2013;One December day, Brownie Groundhog shares a last picnic with her friends before she heads home to hibernate. Fox is sad that he won't see her until February, but she reassures him that he can keep himself busy doing wintry things. Bunny tries to cheer him up, but the fox is cold and forlorn until they decide to go and borrow Brownie's red scarf. Despite a Do Not Disturb sign, Fox awakens his friend and the sleepy groundhog mumbles something that Fox is certain is a &#x201c;yes.&#x201d; He discovers other fun things in Brownie's house and borrows them as well. Not long afterward, Brownie is awakened by loud music and wanders outside to see where it is coming from. Fox and Bunny have decorated a huge tree and turned it into a wintry extravaganza. The surprise is magnificent and Brownie decides to stay up and celebrate with her friends before settling back down to snooze. The acrylic paintings are inviting and the spread of the decorated tree is glorious. The ending of this tale of friendship is most satisfying. This book is a natural for a winter celebration that is not attached to Christmas.&#x2013;Joan Kindig, James Madison University, Harrisonburg, VA&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Confronted with the dual mandate of production and preservation, the U.S. Forest Service decided it could achieve both goals through more intensive management.

Focusing on the ideas of &#34;sustained yield&#34;, &#34;multiple use&#34;, and &#34;intensive management&#34;, Paul W. Hirt describes how the first two of these ideas represent the admirable objectives of achieving balance and sustainability in the management of our publicly owned forest lands. However, since the Second World War, neither multiple use nor sustained yield have been effectively implemented. Criticism of the Forest Service has grown since 1945, when demands for commodities accelerated and the agency strove to meet them through its program of intensive management. Although these demands for resources often clashed with &#34;sustainable&#34; limits, the provision of products and services, such as timber and recreation, enhanced the agency&#39;s reputation and budget. Confronted with the dual mandate of production and preservation, the agency decided it could achieve both through more intensive management. For a few decades, this &#34;conspiracy of optimism&#34; masked the fact that high levels of resource extraction were destroying forest ecosystems. The repercussions of this management regime - massive clear-cuts, polluted streams, declining wildlife populations, and marred scenery - proved to be socially unacceptable. This book documents the reasons the U.S. Forest Service stands accused of collaborating in the exploitation of our national forests. Hirt illuminates recent changes in administration and policy which suggest a hopeful future for federal lands.Paul W.

From a career as a, yes, ruthless pimp in the '40s and '50s, Iceberg Slim refashioned himself as the first and still the greatest of "street lit" masters, whose vivid books have made him an icon to such rappers as Ice-T, Jay-Z, and Snoop Dogg and a presiding spirit of "blaxploitation" culture. You can't understand contemporary black (and even American) culture without reckoning with Iceberg Slim and his many acolytes and imitators. </b><br><br>Literature professor Justin Gifford has been researching the life and work of Robert Beck for a decade, culminating in&nbsp;<i>Street Poison</i>, a colorful and compassionate biography of one of the most complicated figures in twentieth-century literature. Drawing on a wealth of archival material&#x2014;including FBI files, prison records, and interviews with Beck, his wife, and his daughters&#x2014;Gifford explores the sexual trauma and racial violence Beck endured that led to his reinvention as Iceberg Slim, one of America's most infamous pimps of the 1940s and '50s. From pimping to penning his profoundly influential confessional autobiography,&nbsp;<i>Pimp</i>, to his involvement in radical politics, Gifford's biography illuminates the life and works of one of American literature's most unique renegades.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of August 2015:</strong> You might not know who Iceberg Slim is, but there's no escaping his influence. Born Robert Beck in 1918, at the height of the "Great Migration" that brought millions of African Americans out of the South and into northern cities, he spent the formative years of his life practicing various street hustles in the "black belt" of Milwaukee. His initial trial-and-error approach resulted in several prison stints, where he completed his education with a master class in pimping under the tutelage of the more accomplished inmates. (He also studied Freud, rounding out his talents as a manipulator.) His training served him well, as it were, as evidenced by a notorious 25-year criminal career punctuated by several more trips to the cooler. Following his last incarceration in 1961, Beck gave up the game, joining his ailing mother in Los Angeles while turning his energy toward writing. And this is why you <em>might</em> know who Iceberg Slim is: His books--notably his epic autobiography, <em>Pimp</em>--became unlikely underground bestsellers, with millions read or purchased seemingly anywhere but where books are sold. Inspiring generations of writers and performers who followed--including Donald Goines, Dave Chappelle, Ice-T, and Ice-Cube (the latter two choosing their pseudonyms as homage)--Iceberg Slim codified a unique American subculture, transforming it into popular culture in the process.</p> <p>But what to make of Justin Gifford's biography? It's certainly not a redemption story. Robert Beck was not often a good man, and the straightforward descriptions of his repugnant, businesslike brutality--often in his own words--are difficult to read. The tragic figure of Beck's mother orbits the story, providing a kind of moral gravity (albeit weak) that occasionally and eventually pulls him away from his illicit lifestyle, but he's mostly a source of devastating pain for her. This isn't hagiography either; while addressing the gaudier aspects of pimp culture--again, popularized by Slim--Gifford is careful to avoid sensationalism or glorification, despite the occasional foray into Slim's own streetwise vernacular. Ultimately, <em>Street Poison</em> is a compulsively readable story of an unseemly man, whose legacy was as unforeseeable as it was impactful. --<em>Jon Foro</em></p>Dr. Justin Gifford is an Associate Professor of English Literature at the University of Nevada, Reno.

These ideas and beliefs were propelled throughout her time in office by a forcefulness and conviction, particularly in critical moments in her premiership - the Falklands War, the miner&#39;s strike, the Brighton bomb and her three election victories. In the second volume of her memoirs, following &#34;The Downing Street Years&#34;, she reveals the inspiration behind many of her philosophies. She discusses the formative years of her childhood in Grantham, the values she learnt at home, the profound influence of her shopkeeeping father, and of her own schooling on future Conservative education policies. She recounts her days at Oxford, her academic work as a scientist, marriage to Dennis, and the beginning of her career as a politician when in 1959 she was selected to stand at Finchley. She gives her views on the governments of Harold Macmillan, Alec Douglas-Home, Harold Wilson, Edward Heath and Jim Callaghan, and sets out the development of her ideas during her time in opposition.</p><p>In her international bestseller, <i>The Downing Street Years</i>, Margaret Thatcher provided an acclaimed account of her years as Prime Minister.

In a series of brilliant but meticulous studies, he ranges widely across the domains of painting, music, literature and the plastic arts, his fertile mind opening more general, philosophical perspectives. <i>Look, Listen, Read</i> begins with an analysis of Nicolas Poussin's method of visual composition, and after drawing a surprising parallel with Marcel Proust, moves into a fascinating discussion, joined by Ingres and Delacroix among others, on the art of painting. Next the author turns to music, taking his inspiration from an inquiry into certain chord modulations in Rameau's opera Castor et Pollux, which at the time of its composition were considered a musical breakthrough. The book then considers the nature of the beautiful.&#x201d; The reference point here remains the French Enlightenment, and in particular Diderot's reflections on painting. Focusing on the aesthetic controversies of this same period, but with regard to music, a fascinating series of chapters revives the work of the largely forgotten eighteenth-century musicologist Michel-Paul-Guy de Chabanon and his surprisingly contemporary discussion of music's partial resemblance to language. This leads to a consideration of the relations of words to music in opera, where L�vi-Strauss reveals something of his own tastes in music while engaging in a critical review of a work by his recently deceased friend and colleague, Michel Leires. The relation between sounds and colors is considered next, largely through a breathtaking examination of a famous but difficult poem by Arthur Rimbaud. There follows an exchange of notes with Andr� Breton, written some fifty years ago, on the nature of the work of art. In the book's concluding chapters the author dons the more familiar mantle of the anthropologist, and by looking at the myths of the American Indians, offering an analysis of their understanding of the place of art and of the artist in their own societies. <i>Look, Listen, Read</i> is a truly original work, far removed from the intellectual fads that mark contemporary discussions on aesthetics, as L�vi-Strauss advances into new territory even as he remains faithful to his structuralist inspiration. The book weaves a dense tissue of connections, correspondences, and principles, while at the same time remaining sensitive to the specificities of each of the beaux-arts. In a valedictory statement capping a lifetime's work, L�vi-Strauss has made a major new contribution to our understanding of the place of art in human life, the nature of its appeal, the source of its creativity, and its universality.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchIn this slim volume of fragmentary musings, the renowned octogenarian anthropologist reflects engagingly on the high culture of his native France. Avatar of structuralism, author of both dense theoretical tomes and accessible autobiographical works--most famous among the latter is Tristes Tropiques--L&#x201a;vi-Strauss (The Story of Lynx, 1995) remains without peer in his academic field. This volume finds him turning his anthropological gaze toward home, focusing on the art and literature of the French Enlightenment. His opening chapters feature an intriguing analysis of the 17th-century painter Poussin's Et in Arcadia ego theme, which, L&#x201a;vi-Strauss argues, enabled him to knot together in his pictures nature and culture, life and death. The discussion peters out into an unfocused look at various Enlightenment theories of artistic expression, but this interlude provides a bridge into a cogent treatment of the composer Rameau and his opera Castor et Pollux. The anthropologist argues that we should keep in mind, when listening to 18th-century music, that audiences then were more attuned to music theory than audiences today. In the writings of the Enlightenment music theorist Chabanon, L&#x201a;vi-Strauss finds early intimations of structuralism; he then traces the idea that the expressive languages of the different arts correspond to one another through a reading of Rimbaud's famous synesthetic sonnet likening the vowels to colors. Closing sections contain a historic artifact from 50-odd years ago: L&#x201a;vi-Strauss's famous shipboard correspondence with the surrealist poet and theorist Andr&#x201a; Breton. From his opening consideration of how Proust's ``completed work resembles a mosaic where each piece retains its own face and character'' to his account of how basket-weavers produce objects able to take on a life of their own, what L&#x201a;vi-Strauss offers here is a series of allegories for his own craftsmanship. As a belle-lettrist, L&#x201a;vi-Strauss is more than passable. But his best insights come when he captures an outsider's perspective on his own heritage. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He is a nationally known speaker and storyteller, and teaches literature and creative writing at Valparaiso University. <p>Tim Ladwig has illustrated and designed books for children and adults. His Psalm Twenty-Three was a finalist for the Gold Medallion Award in children&#x2019;s books. Ladwig lives in Wichita, Kansas.</p>Ages 4^-7. Probity Jones is upset because she is too sick to take her role in the Christmas pageant. Worse, she became ill when her new jacket was stolen by some tough kids in the neighborhood, and her mother is too poor to buy another one. After Probity has encouraged her little brother, he can do his part without her being on stage, and the family leaves for the pageant; she is alone, miserable that the part of the angel who tells Mary to "fear not" will be played by someone else. Then, to Probity's amazement, a real angel appears at the window, wraps Probity in her soft shawl, and whisks her to the scene of the Nativity pageant, where she can appreciate her brother's performance, and then flies her up to the heavenly host before bringing her back home. Did the angel really come? Probity has the shawl to prove it. The story is loose, and the fantasy is at times overwritten, but the artwork, featuring a joyful African American family and a haunting dark-skinned angel, will stay with readers and listeners.

Spanning two thousand years of social, intellectual, and political change, the essays in these volumes investigate two central questions through all aspects of Chinese life: what core values sustained this ancient civilization through centuries of upheaval, and in what ways did these values survive in modern times?<br><br>From Ying-shih Y�'s perspective, the <i>Dao</i>, or the Way, constitutes the inner core of Chinese civilization. His work explores the unique dynamics between Chinese intellectuals' discourse on the <i>Dao</i>, or moral principles for a symbolized ideal world order, and their criticism of contemporary reality throughout Chinese history. Volume 2 of <i>Chinese History and Culture</i> completes Ying-shih Y�'s systematic reconstruction and exploration of Chinese thought over two millennia and its impact on Chinese identity. Essays address the rise of Qing Confucianism, the development of the Dai Zhen and Zhu Xi traditions, and the response of the historian Zhang Xuecheng to the Dai Zhen approach. They take stock of the thematic importance of Cao Xueqin's eighteenth-century masterpiece <i>Honglou meng</i> (<i>Dream of the Red Chamber</i>) and the influence of Sun Yat-sen's <i>Three Principles of the People</i>, as well as the radicalization of China in the twentieth century and the fundamental upheavals of modernization and revolution. Ying-shih Y� also discusses the decline of elite culture in modern China, the relationships among democracy, human rights, and Confucianism, and changing conceptions of national history. He reflects on the Chinese approach to history in general and the larger political and cultural function of chronological biographies. By situating China's modern encounter with the West in a wider historical frame, this second volume of <i>Chinese History and Culture</i> clarifies its more curious turns and contemplates the importance of a renewed interest in the traditional Chinese values recognizing common humanity and human dignity.</p><p>Ying-shih Y� is a preeminent historian of China. Awarded the John W. Kluge Prize for achievement in the Study of Humanity and the inaugural Tang Prize International Award in Sinology, he has published more than thirty books and five hundred articles and essays on Chinese history, thought, politics, and culture.

Despite the numerous topics, Y�'s essays manage to be incredibly rich, groundbreaking, and enlightening. This truly is a superb collection of his most important scholarly works in the English language.

The topics range from early ideas about immortality to later ideas about the social standing of men of business. No other publication in English compares in terms of command of traditional Chinese sources and sensitivity to contemporary historiographical issues, all mobilized in the service of better understanding China's past in relation to China's present.

J. Dionne brings up to date his influential proposals for a politics that can and must find a balance between rights and obligations, between responsibility and compassion.</b> <br> From the New, Updated Introduction:<br> "At the heart of <i>Why Americans Hate Politics</i> is the view that ideas shape politics far more than most accounts of public life usually allow. I believe ideas matter not only to elites and intellectuals, but also to rank and file voters. Indeed, I often think that the rank and file see the importance of ideas more clearly than the elites, who often find themselves surprised by the rise of the movements that arise from the bottom up and shape our politics."</p><p>All over the United States, Americans are deserting the political process. Why? In this national bestseller, one of our shrewdest political observers traces thirty years of volatile political history and finds that on point after point, liberals and conservatives are framing issues as a series of &#34;false choices,&#34; making it impossible for politicians to solve problems, and alienating voters in the process. Now with a new afterword discussing the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings and the 1992 presidential election, Dionne explores what has gone wrong with the American system and offers a back-to-basics approach to politics designed to respond to the anger of America&#39;s restive majority.E.J.

He is the author of <i> Writing on the Wall: Word and Image in Modern Art</i> and coauthor of <i>The Winchester Guide to Keywords and Concepts for International Students in Art, Media and Design</i>.<p>In the nineteenth century, the sublime coupled awe with fear of nature, as well as fear of the bogeyman that was the Industrial Revolution. Thomas Cole, Frederic Church, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Emily Bront�, Thomas Hardy and Edgar Allen Poe responded. In the twentieth century, two world wars and the two atomic bombs must have had something to do with the sublime pathos of Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, Francis Bacon and the poetry of Wallace Stevens. In this anthology, Simon Morley looks to the twenty-first century, to our sublime. Nothing could be more relevant -- socially, morally or aesthetically. </p> (Bill Beckley, artist and editor of <i>Sticky Sublime</i>)<br><br><p>The sublime is spectacularly envisioned by the artists in this book, and gracefully articulated by its authors. The contributors show us that the world can still be transformed. Many of these works and texts perform the contemporary sublime. They open a schism between expectation and sensation, expanding the horizon between the known territories of the real and our capacity to imagine otherwise. They show us that we may still be taken by surprise by scenes of wonder. Aesthetic experience at the brink of our senses removes the familiar ground on which we know and experience the existential condition of being.</p> (Johanna Drucker, Breslauer Professor of Bibliographical Studies, University of California at Los Angeles)</p><h2>The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven: A Remarkable Account of Miracles, Angels, and Life beyond This World</h2><p>In 2004, Kevin Malarkey and his six-year-old son, Alex, suffered an horrific car accident.

What sounds like a run-of-the-mill writing assignment, however, becomes an excuse for Steve to reflect on the last four years (from Texas freshman to California senior), and figure out where it all went wrong. Maybe it was when he discovered that he really couldn't relate to his father, the Famous Astronaut. Or it could be because his "heart had been run through frapp�, puree, and liquefy on a love blender" by his ex-girlfriend, Wanda "Dub" Varner. No matter where the finger of blame ends up pointing, it's a wild ride of self-enlightenment as Steve discovers that not all relationships are permanent, and that some--like the one with his dad--can be mended with a little work. With Steve, author Rob Thomas has taken a teenage outsider and given him a funny, intelligent voice: "There are those males who merely fill ear holes with tiny studs hardly big enough to offend a Marine. Not me. Most days I wear big hoops. When I combine the look with a doo rag, I'm a regular pirate."

I am so glad I told Adah how much I enjoyed her walks back then, and I am so glad too that we've had so many good walks together as well. Like Adah, I am blessed to live here, and we both are humbled by the friendly strangers and locals we meet daily, especially when we let a walk take us on a new adventure around town or up a familiar stairway and hill in any sort of weather.<br><br>Adah sees how stairways knit our neighborhoods together, embracing our various little enclaves strung along over hill and yonder dale. My own interest in the city took on a new dimension once I started exploring it through Adah's stairway walks, and I never doubt what treasures I can still discover when escalating by foot, tread, and riser to the next platform up ahead. I am honored to continue this work for Adah, happily highlighting all the little gems this city wants to share with us. Also, ascending ambulation is absolutely awesome, but let me walk that back--what I mean is, I enjoy walking up (and down) stairs too, so it's a great pleasure to continue Adah's stairway walks in this newest, eighth edition.<br><br>I have added two new walks and updated all 29 existing walks with new information, where changes or improvements that impacted the walk or its landmarks occurred since the last edition. Look for the Adah Bakalinsky Stairway in Walk 30 (The Good View). Imagine what once was a brawling bowery and bustling immigrant community now scraped away from tiny Irish Hill in Walk 31 (The Serendipity Slipknot), which still includes one stairway.<br><br>But before we get started, and for those of you who have not been on this journey with Adah before, let me first say a bit more about where you are at least reading about walking, if you are not already moving, around there, or here--right now.<br><br>All civilizations have built stairs, and the oldest still preserved date back to 7000 BCE. The Greeks and, before them, the Egyptians, and then, before them, Phoenicians, Sumerians, and Elamites too, used steps and terraces to farm, travel, pray, and even practice sacrifice. Moving up was desired and beneficial, unless you were, of course, an unwilling sacrifice.<br><br>Because stairs have been used for so long, their inventor is probably lost to the ages. However, ever since those first unknown walkers pressed their soles into soft earth and yielding roots in the hill ahead, and until they clambered onward and upward just to get where they wanted to go or to escape what they wanted to get away from, stairs were just waiting to be discovered.<br><br>Classical stairway design influenced European design, from Italy with Palladio to France with Nicolas Blondel, the standard design for tread and riser became part of architectural treatises and materials widely adopted and used from the 17th through the 20th centuries in both America and Europe, and these designs still influence public and private stairway design in cities worldwide.<br><br>San Francisco is a "walking city." Built upon 43 hills, with another 28 thrown in for good measure, the city is surrounded by the Bay on the east, the Pacific Ocean to the west, a peninsula to the south, and the Golden Gate to the north. Within these confines, however, variety is constant. Light and water combine to produce striking effects on bridges and buildings throughout the day; and at sunset, beams of light dramatize the hills and sides of houses, casting colors like C�zanne. Mirrored tiles and windows glitter like mosaic tiles on the magic stairway at Moraga and 16th Avenue, and its fantastic new sibling at 16th and Kirkham, the Hidden Garden Steps. Come out at sunrise, sunset, in the fog, or in the sun, and take a walk.<br><br>Hills and mountains were made to be climbed, and stairways make it easier to traverse them. The hills accelerate changes in perspective as you walk around corners or circle the ridges. Landmarks recede and suddenly emerge in a landscape abounding in inclines and angled streets. The Mt. Sutro TV Tower viewed from the mid-Sunset District is a beautiful sky sculpture; from the Sutro Urban Forest, it looks like a ship in space. From Ashbury Heights, it looks pedestrian. Then it appears large again, and within touching distance from the Outer Sunset District; now walk two blocks toward it, and it appears distant and small.<br><br>The streets of San Francisco range from comparatively flat, such as Irving, to almost vertical, such as sections of Duboce, Filbert, and Duncan. The city's founders and developers found grading the streets on hills a primary obstacle when converting San Francisco from a tent town into a city of timbered houses. Some of the hills were completely demolished in the process; others were cut into without much planning. When the task seemed insurmountable, the "street" ended. Our streets were pummeled and pushed into rectangular grids familiar from the East Coast, but inappropriate for our terrain. Paved streets often follow the contours of hills, but the stairways allow a direct vertical approach from one street to another. They provide accessibility to public transportation; they provide safety in case of fire; and they limit degradation of the land. Plus everyone loves a shortcut.<br><br>Within the city limits, there are more than 671 stairways of all descriptions: crooked, straight, short, long, concrete, wood, balustraded, unadorned, narrow, and wide. Some of the stairways are not as easily identified; look on the sidewalk to see if the stairway name is given there--sometimes it is even if a stairway does not have a sign. Sometimes their names are assumed, much like those of some lesser-known hills in the city are.<br><br>These walks are designed for the curious walker who loves to explore. Each walk takes between two and two and a half hours if you enjoy all the sights, scents, and sounds along the way. Walks in more well-known neighborhoods like Pacific Heights and Telegraph Hill are here, as are walks in less well-known neighborhoods like Eureka Valley, Edgehill, and Dogpatch. All of the walks offer visual interest in the immediate setting and surrounding areas and also often produce new organic stories shared by neighbors near the stairs.<br><br>The walks are best enjoyed at a pace considered reasonable or steady--give yourself time to look around. The pace of a walk is almost as important as its length or difficulty since everyone needs to give themselves more time to think and imagine. Here, your destination is the walk, so you've already arrived. By slowing down, walking half as fast, and taking in what surrounds you, time is the bonus, the joy is in the moving, and the reward is in the path.<br>The beginning point of each walk can be reached by public transportation. Buses are available at several points of most walks, and alternate routes are occasionally suggested for specific reasons. Some of the walks are quite strenuous, but the rewards of stupendous views and delightful discoveries justify the effort.<br><br>In order to appreciate the scaffolding of the city and the variety of neighborhoods within a whistle's call, I've included some graceful links to other walks in other neighborhoods that can be traversed comfortably in a single session. Look for these recommendations in each walk's Further Rambling section.<br><br>Using the map given for a particular walk is helpful if you can locate yourself; use the map legend, and orient yourself on the map and the points of the compass. Each walk's quick-step instructions correspond to the numbered circles on its map. Orienting yourself will help you know which direction you are facing when you can't see the sun rising in the east or setting in the west, when it is foggy, for instance. Look for street numbers and landmarks too, and always watch for traffic. Always look carefully when crossing streets, and remember drivers may not see you if they are distracted, so do be careful.<br><br>I suggest that walkers carry the following gear to make their adventure more comfortable: binoculars, a city map, a compass, water, fruit, sunscreen, and layered clothing, especially long pants and long-sleeved shirts for walks where vegetation may hide poison oak. I use the directions left and right, but also the compass points (north, east, south, and west) to provide additional assurance. I also highly recommend the map "Nature in the City," which is available for free from the Department of Recreation and Parks. It shows the parks and other green areas in the city.<br><br>This edition includes an updated list of every public stairway in San Francisco (see the appendix). Charles Brock has walked every public stairway and every step in San Francisco, and his efforts doubled the previous list. We added one new stairway to this edition's list and are on the lookout for new public stairways to add as necessary. The descriptions in the walks were up-to-date at publication time. However, neighborhoods continually evolve.

When Norm Shepard, an ex-Marine, is found shot in the back only minutes away from the nation&#39;s capital, this sets into motion an investigation that reveals a chilling discovery. The terrorists are already here-not only in Washington, D.C. but throughout the U.S., the plan is set, and the biological agent is on its way.Emergency meetings are called, but it becomes clear that the U.S. is totally unprepared for a crisis of this magnitude. As the enormity of the threat and its ramifications set in, President Robert Hardy assigns Ross Chambers, an intelligence officer, another mission-the closest guarded secret in Washington-the Bluelight Project.The President, without the knowledge or consent of Congress, has been secretly funding the construction of underground protective relocation facilities. Ross is racing against the clock and the very future of the country is at stake. Either the terrorists are apprehended before they can strike or the Bluelight Project must be fully operational before they do-or there may no longer be a United States of America.</p><p>Ray Derby spent 40 years providing information on chemical, biological, and radiological personal protection in the emergency management field as a Civil Defense Director, a Civilian Disaster Preparedness Officer for the U.S. Air Force, and as a Federal Emergency Coordinator.

Rather, they are biblical doctrines, as Dr. Steven J. Lawson demonstrated in his book <em>Foundations of Grace</em> (2006). Now, in <em>Pillars of Grace</em>, Dr. Lawson shows that the doctrines of grace have been understood and taught sometimes in embryonic form, sometimes with great clarity throughout church history. From the time of the early church fathers to the years of the Reformers, there have been key men in the church, pillars as it were, who stood on the foundation of Scripture and upheld the truth of God's sovereign role in salvation.</p><p><strong>Chapters</strong></p><ul><li>Pillars of Sovereign Grace</li><li>First among the Fathers</li><li>God-Bearer</li><li>Defender of the Faith</li><li>Opposing Gnosticism</li><li>Father of Latin Theology</li><li>Master of Rhetoric</li><li>Against the World</li><li>Resisting Arianism</li><li>Expositor of the Trinity</li><li>Imperial Conscience</li><li>Guardian of Grace</li><li>Spanish Scholar</li><li>Champion for Predestination</li><li>Philosopher-Theologian</li><li>Monastic Reformer</li><li>Doctor Profundus</li><li>Morning Star of the Reformation</li><li>Fiery Forerunner</li><li>Fortress for Truth</li><li>Zurich Revolutionary</li><li>Prince of Translators</li><li>Covenant Theologian</li><li>Theologian for the Ages</li></ul><p><strong>Resources and Tools</strong></p><ul><li>One in the three-volume <em>A Long Line of Godly Men</em> series</li><li>Scripture index</li><li>Subject index</li></ul></p><p>Dr. Steven J.

He is a board member and teaching fellow for Ligonier Ministries, a board member and professor of preaching at The Master&#39;s Seminary, professor in residence for Truth Remains, and a visiting professor in the Doctor of Ministry program at Ligonier Academy. A popular conference speaker and author, Dr. Lawson&#39;s books include, The Evangelistic Zeal of George Whitefield, The Gospel Focus of Charles Spurgeon, and Pillars of Grace.<p>This book will ignite and impassion your heart for the gospel and the doctrines of grace that undergird it. Dr. Lawson has done something for which we will forever be grateful- he demonstrates conclusively that the truths of Calvinism and the Reformed faith are rooted in the history of the church, from the apostles to the emergence of Martin Luther in the sixteenth century. We have, of course always suspected this to be true, but few attempts have been made to demonstrate it, and none with such infectious zeal as is to be found in these pages. Few writers can marry church history, exposition, and sound doctrine in such a manner as this. Do not start reading this book unless you are prepared to find that you are unable to put it down. It is that good.</p> --Dr. Derek W. H.

During her busy combat career she demonstrated that battleships could perform very well indeed in their new role as escorts for fleet aircraft carriers and weapon platforms providing fire support for ground troops. Having earned no fewer than 15 Battle Stars during her wartime service, North Carolina was the most highly decorated US Navy battleship of World War II.

This text is the English translation of the &#34;Editio Typica&#34; and includes a 64-page readers&#39; guide. There have been some changes, including: the original sentence on criminal punishment has been omitted, reflecting a developing consensus within the Catholic community against this practice; a reference to angels has been dropped in a passage where it was not necessary to the main point and so was distracting; there is a more nuanced approach to some sexual issues, with a greater emphasis on psychological and social factors affecting the relative culpability of certain acts.</p><p><i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> is the first new edition of the catechism in 400 years. Catechism means "instruction," and this text will remain the standard reference for Catholics for many future generations. It is the authoritative summary of Catholic belief regarding the Church creeds, sacraments, commandments, and prayers. To get some idea of the level of detail with which the Catechism engages Catholic doctrine, consider that 17 pages of explanation accompany the opening words of the Apostle's Creed ("I Believe in God the Father"). The book is exceptionally well organized, with line-by-line explanations of every conceivable aspect of orthodox Catholic belief. Extensive cross-referencing, indexing, footnotes, and "In Brief" summaries of each section further ease the project of finding the precise answers to any questions a reader might have. Even the layout of information on the page is easy on the eyes, with wide margins for readers who wish to make notes. Furthermore, the back cover features a true rarity in the annals of world literature: a blurb by the Pope. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Four centuries in the making, a monumental undertaking and a magnificent achievement, the first definitive Catholic Catechism since the Council of Trent in 1566 details the doctrine, dogma, and the basic tenets of the Church. &#34;A sure and certain standard for the teaching of the faith.&#34; -- Pope John Paul II.</p><h2>The Snow Queen</h2><p>Hard to Find book</p><p></p><h2>Rail-Trails Midwest Great Lakes: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin</h2><p>With 113 rural, suburban, and urban trails threading through 2,300 miles, Rail-Trails Midwest: Great Lakes covers Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin.

It's a cold case, but for Detective Harry Bosch, it stirs up memories of his childhood as an orphan. He can't let it go. As the investigation takes Bosch deeper into the past, a beautiful rookie cop brings him alive in the present. No official warning can break them apart--or prepare Bosch for the explosions when the case takes a few hard turns. Suddenly all of L.A. is in an uproar, and Bosch, fighting to keep control, is driven to the brink of an unimaginable decision.</strong></p><p>Since his first appearance in 1992's Edgar-winning <i>The Black Echo</i>, Detective Hieronymous "Harry" Bosch has joined Dennis Lehane's Patrick and Angie, George Pelecanos's Derek Strange, and Greg Rucka's Atticus Kodiak in the pantheon of new-school hard-boiled detectives. Rather than giving Bosch a clever gimmick (like Jeffery Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme, who is a quadriplegic), Michael Connelly embraces the noir archetype: Bosch, an L.A. homicide detective, is a chain-smoking loner who refuses to play by his superiors' rules. Although he has quit smoking, Harry's still the same tightlipped outsider, taking each crime as a personal affront as he tries to cleanse his beloved city of the darkness he sees engulfing it. <p> In <i>City of Bones</i>, Connelly's eighth Bosch title, Bosch and his well-dressed partner, Jerry Edgar, are working to identify a child's skeleton, buried for 20 years in the forest off Hollywood's Wonderland Drive, and to bring the killer to belated justice. For Bosch this is more than just another homicide, as the mystery child, beaten and abandoned, comes to represent much of what he sees as evil in his city. Add in a tragic love affair with a fellow cop, complications from overzealous media, and the growing feeling that he's fighting a losing battle about which no one cares, and the usually stoic Bosch is pushed to his limits. This isn't the strongest plot Connelly has concocted for Bosch, but it leads to an ending the whole series has been building toward. The conclusion may not shock longtime fans, but it will leave them wondering where the series will go from here. <i>--Benjamin Reese</i></p>Michael Connelly is the author of the recent #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers <i>The Fifth Witness, The Reversal</i>, <i>The Scarecrow</i>, <i>The Brass Verdict</i>, and <i>The Lincoln Lawyer,</i> as well as the bestselling Harry Bosch series of novels.

Dismas Hardy, the former bartender, loving husband and father, and reluctant defense attorney of The 13th Juror, returns here in his most challenging case. Vowing to spend more time with his family, Dismas is hesitant to represent Graham Russo, a could-have-been-great baseball player-turned-lawyer who is indicted for the murder of his father, Sal. Everyone close to the Russos knew that Sal was dying and that he needed morphine injections to ease his suffering. Graham admits to administering these injections, but insists he wasn&#39;t there the night of Sal&#39;s overdose. Was it suicide, mercy, or murder?</p><p>Dismas Hardy, the dart-playing, saloon-keeping lawyer who is one of John Lescroart's most consistently interesting and appealing heroes, faces a dilemma: if he can prove to a jury that Graham Russo helped his father Sal kill himself because the sick old man asked him to, a liberal San Francisco jury will probably vote to acquit Graham of first-degree murder. Hardy would love to plead manslaughter to escape the wrath of the state's attorney general who wants to nail Graham. However, despite the evidence against him, Graham insists he didn't do it. What is a lawyer to do, and who can he believe?<p> Although Lescroart leads the reader up and down a few blind alleys before the truth comes out, the mystery's not the thing here. It's the characters and their back stories that make this such a good read. Foremost among them is Graham, who washed out of pro baseball and walked out of a promising law career before finding the father who once deserted him long ago. The core of the story is Graham's relationship with Sal, who's losing his mind to Alzheimer's but may still be a threat to a federal judge who was once his closest friend. Then there's Sarah Evans, the homicide cop who falls in love with her suspect. For good measure, there are some changes in the lives of those characters who are familiar to readers from other Dismas Hardy adventures--Abe Glitsky, the half Jewish, half black cop; Drysdale, the D.A. who's been beaten in court by Dismas in previous outings; Frannie, Dismas's wife; Moses, his brother-in-law; and Dismas himself, who becomes more interesting every time Lescroart brings him back. While the pacing is langorous and the denouement not as tight as it might be, <i>The Mercy Rule</i> provides a complex and satisfying reading experience. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Advance praise for <i>The Mercy Rule:</i><p>"John Lescroart has written a thought-provoking and important novel.

Faolan saw its touch on the land as he traveled southward out of the province of Ulaid toward a place called Cloud Hill. In the mornings the grass was crisp with frost and a shroud of mist hung low over the hills, wrapping itself around barn and stable, cottage and byre. The fields held only stubble, among which crows made leisurely paths, exchanging occasional sharp comments. The skies were uniformly gray. So long absent from his homeland, he had forgotten the rain; how it came every day without fail, gently insistent, penetrating cloak and hat and boots so a wayfarer could never be entirely dry.He reached Cloud Hill in a fine, drenching drizzle. The tiny settlement huddled under the sudden rise of the hill, low stone huts clustered in a scattering of leafless rowans, geese gathered in the shelter of an outhouse with only half a roof, a larger hall standing square, with smoke struggling up from the thatch and a skinny gray dog skulking in the doorway. The rain became a downpour; Faolan decided it was time to put aside secrecy, and made for the entry. The dog rumbled a warning as he approached, and a man twitched aside the rough sacking that served as a door, peering out into the rain. The growl became a snarl; the man aimed a kick at the creature and it cringed back into the shadows.&#x201d;What&#x2019;s your business?&#x201d; The tone was both surly and defensive.&#x201d;Shelter from the rain, no more.&#x201d;&#x201d;Not from these parts, are you?&#x201d; the man muttered as Faolan came in. &#x201c;Hardly a day for traveling.&#x201d;There was a small crowd within, gathered around a smoky hearth, ale cups in hand. The wet was an excuse, maybe, for a brief respite from the work of smithy or field. A circle of suspicious eyes greeted Faolan as he made his way toward the fire, his cloak dripping on the earthen floor. He could not tell if this was home or drinking hall; the atmosphere was hardly convivial.&#x201d;Where are you headed?&#x201d; asked the man who had let him in.&#x201d;That depends.&#x201d; Faolan sat down on a bench. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the name of this place?&#x201d;&#x201d;What place are you looking for?&#x201d;He&#x2019;d need to take this carefully. Deord&#x2019;s kin might be among these wary-looking folk, and he would not come right out with his bad news in public. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m seeking a man named Deord,&#x201c; he said. &#x201c;Big fellow, broad shoulders; from over the water in Caitt territory. I&#x2019;m told he has kin in a region known as Cloud Hill.&#x201d;Muttering and whispers. A cup of ale was slid across the table in Faolan&#x2019;s direction; he took it gratefully. It had been a long day&#x2019;s walking.&#x201d;What&#x2019;s Deord to such as you?&#x201d; asked a tall, thin man with calloused hands.&#x201d;Such as I?&#x201d; Faolan kept his tone light. &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;&#x201d;You&#x2019;ve a look of someone,&#x201c; the first man said. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t quite put my finger on it.&#x201d;&#x201d;I&#x2019;ve been away. Years. Deord and I share a past; we were guests in a certain place of incarceration. You&#x2019;ll know where I mean, perhaps. There&#x2019;s a name associated with it, a name folk in these parts will be familiar with.&#x201d;Another silence, then, but with a new feeling to it. The cup of ale was joined by a hunk of bread and a bowl of watery soup brought in by a woman from another chamber behind. She stopped to watch him drink it.&#x201d;You and Deord, hm?&#x201d; the first man said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not here, hasn&#x2019;t been these seven years or more. Not that there aren&#x2019;t folk nearby would be wanting news of the man. By the Dagda&#x2019;s bollocks, that fellow was a fighter and a half. Built like a prize boar, and light as a dancer on his feet. When did you last see him, then? What did you say your name was?&#x201d;Faolan thought of lying and decided it would make things too difficult later. &#x201c;Faolan. Yours?&#x201d;They introduced themselves. The spokesman, Brennan. The tall man, Conor. The woman, Oonagh, wife of Brennan. And others: Donal, Ultan, Aidan. Someone threw another log on the fire, and the ale jug went around again.&#x201d;I saw Deord last summer,&#x201c; Faolan said. &#x201c;We met in Priteni lands.&#x201d; He was hacked apart and died in my arms. He honored a vow and was slain for it. &#x201c;A good man. If he has kin in these parts, I&#x2019;d welcome the chance to speak with them.&#x201d;Brennan glanced at his wife. Conor exchanged looks with Ultan. The gathering was suddenly full of something unspoken.Aidan, a lad of sixteen or so, cleared his throat. &#x201c;Were you really in Breakstone?&#x201d; he asked in a whisper. &#x201c;And you got out, just like him?&#x201d;&#x201d;Hush, lad,&#x201c; said Brennan. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d your wits about you, you&#x2019;d know men don&#x2019;t like to speak of such things.&#x201d; He addressed Faolan again. &#x201c;You know Deord came back? Lasted from plowing to harvest; couldn&#x2019;t cope with it any longer. The time in there scars a man. Only the strongest make it out, and only the strongest of those pick up the pieces of what they had before. He came home and he left again. Where did he go? What&#x2019;s he doing?&#x201d;Sleeping a sleep of no dreams, and the forest creeping over to hide him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d best pass my news to the family first, that&#x2019;s if there is one,&#x201c; Faolan said. &#x201c;He mentioned a sister.&#x201d;&#x201d;You got the Breakstone mark?&#x201d; someone asked in a rush. &#x201c;Show us.&#x201d;It was, Faolan supposed, necessary to prove he was not lying. He obliged by turning his head and lifting his hair to show the little star-shaped tattoo behind his right ear.&#x201d;Just like Deord&#x2019;s,&#x201c; said the man called Ultan. &#x201c;And yet there&#x2019;s a look about you that suggests captors rather than captives. You mentioned a name that goes with talk of Breakstone. Your face puts me in mind of that name; an influential one.&#x201d;&#x201d;It&#x2019;s like a basket of eggs or a creel of shellfish,&#x201c; Faolan said smoothly. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s good ones and bad ones. Every family has both. I was&#x2014;I am a good friend of Deord&#x2019;s. The men who escape Breakstone Hollow are bonded for life. So, his sister? She married a local man, I understand?&#x201d; He drained his cup. &#x201c;This is uncommonly fine ale, Brennan.&#x201d;Brennan favored him with a cautious smile. &#x201c;My own brew. Deord&#x2019;s sister is Anda. They live around the hill in a hut on its own. We don&#x2019;t see much of them. Her man, Dalach, is a farrier; follows the horse fairs. He might be away. You should find someone there. It&#x2019;s wet out; why don&#x2019;t you leave it till the morning? We can find you a pallet in a corner.&#x201d;&#x201d;Thank you,&#x201c; Faolan said, taken aback that the mention of Deord and Breakstone had turned deep suspicion so quickly into welcome. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d best be getting on.&#x201d;&#x201d;The offer stands,&#x201c; said Brennan, glancing at his wife. &#x201c;If you find you need a bed, there&#x2019;s one here. It&#x2019;s a fair walk ove</strong></p></p><h2>The 30-Day Vegan Challenge (New Edition): Over 100 Delicious, Nutritious Plant-Based Recipes and Meal Ideas for Eating Healthfully and Compassionately -- The Ultimate Guide and Cookbook</h2><p><b> Take the 30-Day Vegan Challenge and see the difference a plant-based diet makes in your life!</b> Whether you want to improve your overall health, shed a few pounds, demonstrate your compassion for animals, or help the environment, Colleen Patrick-Goudreau, dubbed "The Vegan Martha Stewart" by VegNews magazine, holds your hand every step of the way, giving you the tools, resources, and recipes you need to make the vegan transition - healthfully, joyfully, and deliciously.

Each time I look over the pages, I find something new and enticing. This is a unique volume that ties the art to the words and gives a unique vision of two masters: King showing a glimpse of the beginnings of this unique talent that has entertained us for years; and, Chadbourne showing his mastery at understanding the written word and turning it into a not to be forgotten picture that enhances the experience. King, Chadbourne, and Cemetery Dance are a trio to contend with and this volume is a triumph in the trio of poetry, painting, and publishing. Don't miss this one of a kind work. --The Baryon Review<br><br>Purportedly scrawled by a college-age King on the back of a restaurant place mat, this glowering poem introduced a wandering character of ultimate evil, who would later mature into Randall Flagg of The Stand, The Eyes of the Dragon, and the Dark Tower series. Therefore, even though this is a curiosity, it's a significant one in the King mythos, and Chadbourne's black-and-white interpretation gives the spare text just the rotten juice it craves. The poem itself is the sort of metaphysical, apocalyptic piece you might expect from the late 1960s, but is nonetheless evocative. It begins, "i have stridden the fuming way / of sun-hammered tracks and / smashed cinders," as we follow the slow nighttime progress of a smudgy man traversing a moonlit America of busted merry-go-rounds, dilapidated trains, and agonized cemeteries. Wordless pages fill out the five-stanza poem, with Chadbourne's flat, snarled pencilwork hiding snakes, spiders, rats, and faces in every twisted tableau. It's all suitably ominous, and bewitched fans will be able to draw a direct line between this and The Gunslinger (1982). --Booklist<br><br>The poem itself is told from The Dark Man's point-of-view, and it's an effectively chilling piece of work. The world he describes is not unlike most King settings, a place where mundane sights like all-night filling stations and wheat fields exist beneath an ominous 'savage sickle moon,' and where sits 'a gutted columned house leeched with vines.' It's strong imagery, and it's easy to see how aspects of the character bled over into King's later work... But where The Dark Man really comes to life is in the marriage of King's text to Glenn Chadbourne's stark, brutal imagery. Thumbing through the book you can almost feel a cold October wind coming off the pages, and you can almost smell the desperation and fear permeating the desolate, broken landscape. Chadbourne's distinctive style has graced a number of King/Cemetery Dance projects, but never has it felt like a more perfect fit than it does here. The drawings are dense, packed with details that seem to shift and flow of their own accord so that each time you study the pages you see something else. It may not be for everybody, but a book like this is sure to please adventurous readers looking for new insight into one of King's most well-known creations. The Dark Man is a moody leap of faith by the creators and the publisher that pays off handsomely in the end. --The October CountryPurportedly scrawled by a college-age King on the back of a restaurant place mat, this glowering poem introduced a wandering character of ultimate evil, who would later mature into Randall Flagg of The Stand, The Eyes of the Dragon, and the Dark Tower series.

Hemingway&#39;s well-known interest in - and fascination with - big-game hunting is magnificently captured in this evocative account of his trip. It is examination of the lure of the hunt and an impassioned portrait of the glory of the African landscape and of the beauty of a wilderness that was, even then, being threatened by the incursions of man.</p><p>6 1.5-hour cassettesErnest Hemingway was born in Chicago in 1899, the second of six children. In 1917, he joined the Kansas City Star as a cub reporter. The following year, he volunteered as an ambulance driver on the Italian front, where he was badly wounded but decorated for his services. He returned to America in 1919, and married in 1921. In 1922, he reported on the Greco-Turkish war before resigning from journalism to devote himself to fiction. He settled in Paris, associating with other expatriates like Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein. He was passionately involved with bullfighting, big-game hunting and deep-sea fishing. Recognition of his position in contemporary literature came in 1954 when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, following the publication of The Old Man and the Sea. He died in 1961.</p><h2>Canadian Exploration Literature</h2><p><p>First published by Oxford University Press in 1993, Exploration Literature is a groundbreaking collection of early writing inspired by the opening of a continent.With maps, notes, and thumbnail biographies of these early writers, Exploration Literature is an entry point for both the casual reader and the student of Canadian literature into the beginnings of a literate response to the awe and wonder inspired by an unfolding geography and the literary fundamentals of new nationhood.</p></p><p>This anthology is an entry point into the beginnings of a literate response to the awe and wonder inspired by an unfolding geography.<p>Germaine Warkentin is professor emeritus at the University of Toronto and an expert on Renaissance writing and early Canadian literature.</p></p><h2>Daedal Doodle</h2><p>This book is for people who crave new words and want to expand their vocabularic horizons; who play Scrabble,do Crossword Puzzles, love New Yorker Cartoons and aren&#39;t too lazy to reach for the OED; lovers of M.C Escher, Salvador Dali, Dr. Seuss and hungry logophiles alike. For almost three years, wherever he went, Victor Stabin brought a dictionary along. Combing through over 8000 pages of a variety of dictionaries he came up with the alliterations that inhabit this work. Inspired by reading many, many ABC books to his young daughters, love of words, and his incessant inability to stop doodling, he unflinchingly created the improbable alliterative combinations and illustrations that inhabit this work. In his heart he knew he was creating a work that despite the use of unusually obtuse words, would have broad appeal and challenge the ABC status quo. Stabin&#39;s ultimate result is a platform that bridges literate curiosity across multiple generations using mostly common and sometimes extraordinarily uncommon imagery in new and inventive ways . Ladies and Gentleman without further ado, presented for your literary and retinal delight...Daedal Doodle</p><p>Victor Stabin - American Artist - born 1954 and raised in New York City. Stabin is a prolific artist whose work captures the spirit of the environment whilst inciting the illusive side of the imagination in one rousing stroke. A painter, author and well-respected illustrator, he is best known for his surreal oils that make ordinary objects and environments extraordinary, as demonstrated by his widely admired Turtle Series and Fish Ferris Wheel . Recently, Stabin abandoned illustration to embrace painting exclusively. He stated, I call myself an eco-surrealist artist. My paintings transport the viewer into dreamscapes by subtly altering everyday life using other species as protagonists. His influences are the 20th Century Surrealists, the 19th Century Japanese watercolor print artists, Advertising Art of the 20th Century and the spirit of the Italian Renaissance. Like Edward Hooper and Thomas Hart Benton before him, Stabin started his art career as an illustrator with credits that include nine signature stamps for the United States Postal Service, a Kiss album cover, and an enormous mural for RCA/BMG s corporate headquarters in New York. Moreover he has produced numerous illustrations for The New York Times, Newsweek, Rolling Stone Magazine, Time Magazine, Scholastic Books, Random House, and the like. In 2004, Stabin and his wife Joan Morykin purchased and renovated a 15,000 sq. ft., 170- year-old factory building in the charming, destination town of Jim Thorpe, PA. The Stabin Morykin Building can be likened to a little slice of SOHO nestled into the mountains of a storybook town. It is the home of the Victor Stabin Gallery (which presently exhibits his most current work), The Dynasty Gallery, Artist Workshop Space and the critically acclaimed Flow Restaurant.Original and Sly --Susan Orlean of the The New Yorker Magazine<br><br>A Visual Stunner with Delightful Definitions --Leonard Lopate of WNYC Radio<br><br>Looking at this book was reminiscent of the first time I viewed the work of M.C.

Buckley, Jr., Ronald Reagan, and William Kristol. Conservatism has assumed a variety of forms, historian Patrick Allitt argues, because it has been chiefly reactive, responding to perceived threats and challenges at different moments in the nation&#x2019;s history.</p><p>While few Americans described themselves as conservatives before the 1930s, certain groups, beginning with the Federalists in the 1790s, can reasonably be thought of in that way. The book discusses changing ideas about what ought to be conserved, and why. Conservatives sometimes favored but at other times opposed a strong central government, sometimes criticized free-market capitalism but at other times supported it. Some denigrated democracy while others championed it. Core elements, however, have connected thinkers in a specifically American conservative tradition, in particular a skepticism about human equality and fears for the survival of civilization. Allitt brings the story of that tradition to the end of the twentieth century, examining how conservatives rose to dominance during the Cold War.

The book shows traditional quilts next to their improvisational cousins, as well as African textiles that demonstrate similarities to this American art.</p><p>Scott Heffley began collecting African-American quilts 20 years ago. His fascination with American folk art and textiles led him into this uncharted territory long before the current popularity of these quilts. When not pursuing his avocation of collecting, Scott restores paintings at the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri. He uses his experience of working on paintings by such masters as Rembrandt, Van Gogh and Sargent when he looks at quilts and discusses their color relationships, artistic merit and aesthetics. He loves to immerse himself in the beauty and history of objects, whether at the museum, in antique markets or at home. Scott graduated from Bucknell University in Pennsylvania with degrees in chemical engineering, chemistry and studio art. His conservation graduate degree is from the Cooperstown Graduate Program in New York.Unpretentious but always right on target, Scott Heffley wants us to see what he sees. The care he brings to enlarging our understanding of African-American quilts sparkles with as much personal warmth as the quilts themselves do from their riotously colorful patchwork. --Marc Wilson, Director, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art<br><br>Scott Heffley has taken contemporary quilt lovers, preservers and collectors on a journey of the evolution of his collection of African American quilts. Most important, he curatorially defines each quilt in the collection within the understanding of contemporary and African and African American ethnic traditional styles. This helps to further understand the history and culture of African and African American textile work and design. Heffley's work will undoubtedly contribute much to the body of knowledge of African American quilting. --Samuel W. Black, Curator of African American Collections, John Heinz History Center, Pittsburgh<br><br>I first saw Scott Heffley's wonderful collection of African American quilts in 1998. I have seen it grow since then and am delighted that it is so beautifully presented in this informative book which I will highly recommend to my colleagues, my friends, and my students. --Dr. Maude Southwell Wahlman, Dorothy and Dale Thompson/Missouri Endowed Professor of Global Arts, The University of Missouri-Kansas City</p><h2>Manners &amp; Customs in the Bible: An Illustrated Guide to Daily Life in Bible Times</h2><p><b>Opening New Windows onto Bible People, Customs, and Contexts</b> <p>Directly after a good concordance and a Bible dictionary, a thoroughly reliable guide to the manners and customs of the Bible is the next must-have resource for any student of the Bible.

In this innovative study, Bruce Redford reveals the web of visual quotations and references that informed Sargent&#x2019;s most ambitious paintings. Throughout his career, Sargent was recognized and rewarded as a &#x201c;Young Master&#x201d; whose bravura portraits inspired comparison with the likes of Vel�zquez, Van Dyck, and Reynolds. At the same time, his paintings responded to the stylistic experiments and cultural preoccupations of a world on the cusp of modernity. Sargent achieved this complex synthesis through a pictorial language composed of witty acts of allusion.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>John Singer Sargent and the Art of Allusion</i> offers the first sustained inquiry into the painter&#x2019;s practice of quotation&#x2014;one that created a complex visual code. Through comparative analysis among thematic groupings of portraits and analogous literary texts, Redford shows how Sargent devised and transmitted that code. The result is an enhanced awareness of Sargent&#x2019;s daring gamesmanship, his place in the history of portraiture, and the dynamics of allusion in both art and literature.</p><p>By decoding the intricate visual references that shaped Sargent&#x2019;s oeuvre, this beautifully illustrated study provides an original new perspective on the work of the great artist.<br><b>Bruce Redford</b> is professor of history of art and architecture at Boston University.&nbsp;</p><h2>The people&#39;s herbal: A family guide to herbal home remedies</h2><p>Over 130 historic recipes using herbs and spices to make tonics and sedatives, lotions and decoctions for relief from such diseases as pleurisy, gastritis, problem of skin, neuralgia, backaches, blisters, burns, colds, colics, coughs, earaches, warts, sore throats and dozens of other ailments.</p><p></p><h2>The Hunger Games Tribute Guide</h2><p>Here is the ultimate guide to the twenty-four Tributes participating in Panem&#39;s 74th annual Hunger Games.

Tour.</p><p>A leading African-American scholar of the law, known for decrying the underrepresentation of minorities in the academy, reflects on protest and race in America. Four years ago, Bell (Law/New York Univ.; Faces at the Bottom of the Well, 1992, etc.), then at Harvard, protested the absence of black women from that university's law faculty by taking an unpaid leave of absence. After much dithering, Harvard failed to hire a black woman law professor; once Bell had taken the two years of leave allowed him by its rules, Harvard fired him, refusing to make an exception for his principled stand. Affecting vignettes reveal how Bell's family inspired and sustained his protest. Accounts of faculty politics, in contrast, find Bell pulling his punches. Rather than settle scores, he seeks to knit his personal and professional experiences into a broad exploration of protest and the responses that it provokes. Alongside of his confrontation with the authorities at Harvard, Bell examines protests by such figures as Paul Robeson, Fannie Lou Hamer, and Martin Luther King while weaving into his book--in a manner familiar to readers of his previous work and to those acquainted with the techniques of ``critical race studies''--an allegorical fable in which citizens of a ruling citadel argue over how to treat the downtrodden outside of their walls. Bell illuminates an ugly picture: Protesters become pariahs, true reform may be impossible to achieve, yet struggle is necessary to preserve dignity and self-esteem. If Bell's pessimism seems a bit hyperbolic, his argument lends moral authority to those who exhort us toward social reform--those such as Bell himself, whose perhaps overdue disillusion with Harvard enables him to forcefully pose questions of how and why the institutional imperatives of power and prestige compromise moral vision. Bell's clearly written jeremiad, with its moving portrait of the author as exemplary protester, will inspire new examinations of struggles in our citadels of power--perhaps even new protests there. (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The first black professor tenured at Harvard Law School, Bell (Faces at the Bottom of the Well) lost his job in 1992 after protesting-by taking an unpaid leave of absence-the school's failure to hire and tenure a woman of color. Reflecting first on his youth and career as a civil rights laywer, Bell offers a candid tale of infighting at Harvard Law. The school, he argues persuasively, places more emphasis on paper credentials than proven skills, thus limiting faculty diversity of race, sex and class. During his first year of protest, Bell agreed to teach a seminar at Harvard for free; in his second year, he was a visiting teacher at New York University Law School, where he remains. He describes how warring ideological factions defeated the appointment of a black woman candidate at Harvard Law. The officials there refused to waive a rule limiting faculty leaves to two years, and Bell was fired as he began his third year of protest. While a few observations here ring false-do students really not protest poor teaching by white professors?-Bell raises important questions about institutional racism and offers resonant thoughts on the tradition of protest and its importance to self-esteem. 25,000 first printing; author tour. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Complete Kylie (25th Anniversary Edition)</h2><p><i>The Complete Kylie Minogue</i> gives the most definitive overview of the performer's career ever published.

He wanted Molly Abberwick. Tonight he intended to ask her to have an affair with him.<br><br>This was a major decision for Harry. But then, most decisions were major for him.<br><br>The opening sentence of his latest book could have served as his personal motto: <i>Absolute certainty is the greatest of all illusions.</i><br><br>As a general rule he applied that principle to his work and to his personal life. A man had only one reliable defense against illusions in both arenas, and that defense was caution. Harry made it a habit to be very, very careful.<br><br>Harry's past as well as his current occupation combined to ensure that he viewed the world with what some people called a marked degree of cynicism. He preferred to call it intelligent skepticism, but the result was the same.<br><br>The good news was that he rarely got conned, scammed, or fleeced.<br><br>The bad news was that a lot of people thought that he was cold-blooded. That, however, did not bother Harry.<br><br>By training and inclination, Harry demanded hard, solid proof in virtually every arena of his life. He had a passion for it. He preferred a logical approach to all things.<br><br>Once in a while, however, his finely tuned brain seemed to skip the usual methodical steps and leaped straight to an insight so shatteringly perceptive that it sometimes scared him. <i>Really</i> scared him. Nevertheless, for the most part, he took satisfaction in exercising his razor-sharp intelligence. He knew that he was much better at thinking than he was at handling relationships.<br><br>Thus far he had moved slowly and carefully toward his goal of beginning an affair with Molly. He did not intend to make the mistake he had made with his ex-fianc�e. He would not become involved with another woman in a desperate attempt to seek an answer to the dark questions about himself that he could not, would not put into words.<br><br>He would settle for sex and companionship this time.<br><br>"Will that be all, Harry?"<br><br>Harry glanced at his part-time housekeeper. Ginny Rondell, a plump, pleasant-faced woman in her late forties, hovered on the other side of the long granite counter that separated the kitchen from the living room of the high-rise condominium.<br><br>"Yes, thank you, Ginny," Harry said. "An excellent meal, by the way."<br><br>Molly Abberwick, seated on the black sofa facing the wall of windows, smiled warmly at Ginny. "It was fantastic."<br><br>Ginny's broad face suffused with pleasure. "Thank you, Ms. Abberwick. The tea is ready, Dr. Trevelyan. Are you sure you don't want me to serve it?"<br><br>"Thanks, I'll handle it," Harry said.<br><br>"Yes, well, I'll say good night, then." Ginny came around the edge of the long counter and trundled toward the green-marble-tiled hall.<br><br>Harry waited with an unfamiliar sense of gathering impatience as Ginny opened a closet door and removed her purse. He waited while she put on her sweater. At last she let herself out through the front door.<br><br>An acute silence fell on the condominium.<br><br>Alone at last, Harry thought, wryly amused at his own eagerness. He hadn't felt this way in a long, long time. He could not even recall the last occasion. It had no doubt occurred at some point in his youth. He was thirty-six, but he had been feeling very ancient for the past eight years.<br><br>"I'll get the tea," he said as he got to his feet.<br><br>Molly nodded. There was an expectant look in her wide, sea green eyes. Harry hoped the expression boded well for his plans for the evening. He had turned off both phones for the night, an unheard-of course of action. Ginny had been astounded.<br><br>True, he generally switched off the business line in the evenings or when he was engaged in intensive study, but he never threw the switch on the family line when he was at home. He was always available to both sides of his feuding clans.<br><br>Harry got to his feet and walked to the granite counter. He picked up the tray containing the pot of tea and two cups. He had ordered the very expensive Darjeeling after having made it his business to discover Molly's personal preference. No sugar. No milk. Harry was good with details.<br><br>Covertly, he studied Molly as he carried the tea tray to the glass table in front of the sofa. There was definitely an undercurrent of excitement stirring in her. He could almost feel it lapping at him in tiny waves. His own anticipation surged.<br><br>Molly sat somewhat primly on the sofa, her attention caught by the lights of the Pike Place Market down below and the dark expanse of Elliott Bay. It was summer in the Northwest, and the days seemed to last forever. But it was after ten o'clock, and night had finally arrived. Along with it had come Harry's opportunity to begin an affair with his client.<br><br>This was not the first time Molly had seen the sights from Harry's twenty-fifth-floor downtown condo. He worked out of his home, and Molly had come here often enough on business during the past month. But this was the first time she had ever seen the sights at night.<br><br>"You have an incredible view from up here," she said as he set the tea tray down on the coffee table.<br><br>"I like it." Harry sat down beside her and reached for the teapot. Out of the corner of his eye he saw her smile. He took that to be another good sign.<br><br>Molly had a very expressive face. Harry could have watched her for hours. The angle of her brows reminded him of a bird on the wing. The image was a good metaphor for Molly. A man who wanted to catch her would have to be very fast and very smart. Harry told himself that he was both.<br><br>Tonight Molly was dressed in a businesslike, moss green pantsuit complete with a one-button jacket and softly pleated trousers. She wore a pair of demure, suede pumps. Harry had never before paid much attention to women's feet, but he found himself captivated by Molly's. They were perfectly arched with delicate ankles. All in all, a marvel of engineering design, he thought.<br><br>The rest of Molly was well designed, too.<br><br>Having given the matter a great deal of close consideration in recent days, Harry had finally concluded that Molly was slender, but definitely not skinny. She practically radiated health and vitality. He was extremely healthy, himself. He had the reflexes of a cat, and he actually felt turbocharged when Molly was in the vicinity.<br><br>There was an appealing roundness to certain portions of Molly's anatomy. The jacket of the pantsuit skimmed over high breasts that Harry knew would fit nicely into his hand. The pleats of the trousers flared to encompass full, womanly hips.<br><br>Although he found her figure eminently interesting, it was Molly's vibrant face that commanded Harry's most serious attention. She was spectacular, he thought with satisfaction. Not spectacularly beautiful, just spectacular. She was unique. Special. Different.<br><br>Intelligence shimmered in her green eyes. Harry acknowledged that he was a sucker for brains in a woman. There was strength and fortitude and character in the delicate yet determined lines of her nose and high cheekbones. Her honey brown hair had a mind of its own. It exploded around her head in a short, thick, frothy mass. The style emphasized the tilt of her fey eyes.<br><br>It occurred to Harry that with those eyes, Molly could have made her living as a carnival fortune-teller. It would have been a simple matter for her to convince any likely mark that she could see straight into his past, present, and future.<br><br>The realization sparked a flash of renewed caution in Harry. The last thing he needed was a woman who could see deeply into his soul. That way lay madness.<br><br>For the space of perhaps three heartbeats he seriously questioned the wisdom of getting involved with a woman whose gaze held such a disconcerting degree of perception. He did not do well with women who were inclined to probe his psyche. His disastrous experience with his ex-fianc�e had proved that much. On the other hand, he had no patience with bimbos.<br><br>For a few seconds Harry let his future hang in the balance as he contemplated his next move.<br><br>Molly gave him a questioning smile, revealing two slightly crooked front teeth. There was something endearing about those two teeth, Harry thought.<br><br>He took a deep breath and consigned his qualms to hell with a breathtaking recklessness that should have alarmed him. It would be okay this time, he told himself. Molly was a businesswoman, not a psychologist. She would take, a rational, levelheaded approach to what he was about to offer. She would not be inclined to dissect him or try to analyze him.<br><br>"I would like to discuss something with you." Harry poured tea into her cup with calm deliberation.<br><br><i>"Yes."</i> Molly gave a little shriek, made a small fist, and pumped it wildly. Her eyes glowed. "Hot damn, I knew it."<br><br>Harry looked up, startled. "You did?"<br><br>She grinned as she picked up her teacup. "It's about time, if you don't mind my saying so."<br><br>Enthusiasm was a good thing in a woman, Harry assured himself. "Uh, no. No, I don't mind. I just hadn't realized that we were on the same wavelength here."<br><br>"You know what they say about great minds thinking alike."<br><br>Harry smiled. "Yes."<br><br>"I realized when you invited me to dinner tonight that this was a special occasion, not an ordinary business consultation."<br><br>"Right."<br><br>"I knew that you had finally made a decision."<br><br>"I have, as a matter of fact." He eyed her closely. "I've given the matter a great deal of thought."<br><br>"Naturally. If I've learned one thing about you during the past few weeks, it's that you give everything a great deal of thought. So you finally concluded that Duncan Brockway's grant proposal is worth funding. About time."<br><br>Harry blanked for a split second. "Brockway's proposal?"<br><br>Molly's eyes sparkled with satisfaction. "I knew you'd approve that one. I just <i>knew</i> it. It's so original. So intriguing. And the potential is absolutely unlimited."<br><br>Harry narrowed his eyes. "This has nothing to do with Brockway's grant proposal. I wanted to talk about another matter."<br><br>The excitement in her eyes dimmed slightly. "You did look it over, didn't you?"<br><br>"Brockway's proposal? Yes, I did. It's no good. We can go into the details later, if you like. But right now I want to discuss something more important."<br><br>Molly looked honestly baffled. "What's more important than Duncan Brockway's grant proposal?"<br><br>Harry set his teacup down with great precision. "Our relationship."<br><br>"Our <i>what?"</i><br><br>"I think you heard me."<br><br>Molly's cup crashed back into its saucer. "That does it, I've had it."<br><br>Harry stilled. "What's wrong?"<br><br>"You have the nerve to ask me what's wrong? After telling, me that you're not going to approve Duncan's proposal?"<br><br>"Molly, I'm trying to conduct an intelligent conversation here. However, it seems to be falling apart. Now, about our relationship -- "<br><br><i>"Our relationship?"</i> Molly erupted from the sofa with the force of a small volcano. "I'll tell you about our relationship. It's a complete, unmitigated disaster."<br><br>"I wasn't aware that we even had one yet."<br><br>"We most certainly do. But it's ending here. Now. Tonight. I refuse to continue to pay for your services as a consultant, Harry Trevelyan. Thus far, I have not received one damn thing for my money."<br><br>"There seems to be a misunderstanding here."<br><br>"I'll say there is." There was green sheet lightning in Molly's eyes. "I thought you invited me to dinner tonight to tell me that you'd approved Duncan Brockway's grant proposal."<br><br>"Why in hell would I invite you to dinner just to tell you that Brockway's proposal is a scam?"<br><br>"It's not a scam."<br><br>"Yes, it is." Harry was not accustomed to having his verdicts questioned. He was, after all, a leading authority in his field.<br><br>"According to you, every single one of the one hundred grant proposals that have been submitted to the Abberwick Foundation have been scams."<br><br>"Not all of them." Harry preferred accuracy to gross generalizations. "Some were just plain bad science. Look, Molly, I'm trying to discuss something else entirely here."<br><br>"Our relationship, I believe you said. Well, it's over, Dr. Trevelyan. This was your last chance. You're fired." <br><br>Harry wondered if he had accidentally stepped into a parallel universe. This was not going according to plan. <br><br>He had made his decision regarding Molly with great care and consideration. True, he had wanted her from the start, but he had not allowed himself to be swept away by physical desire. He had worked from a very basic premise. Following the demise of his engagement over a year ago, he had given his future sex life a great deal of serious contemplation. He had concluded that he knew exactly what he needed in a woman. He wanted a relationship with someone who had a lot of interests of her own, someone who would not require constant attention from him.<br><br>He required a woman who would not take mortal offense when he was consumed with his research. A woman who would not care if he locked himself in his office to work on a book or an investigation. A woman who could tolerate the demands of his personal life.<br><br>Most of all he wanted an affair with a woman who would not question his moods or suggest that he get therapy for them.<br><br>Molly Abberwick had appeared to fit the bill. She was twenty-nine years old, a competent, successful entrepreneur. From what Harry could determine, she had virtually raised her younger sister single-handedly after her mother's death several years earlier. Her father had been a genius, but as was usually the case with the obsessively creative type, he had devoted his time to his inventions, not his children.<br><br>From what Harry could discern, Molly was no fragile flower, but a strong, sturdy plant that could weather the worst storms, perhaps even those that occasionally howled across his own melancholy soul.<br><br>As the proprietor of the Abberwick Tea &amp; Spice Company, Molly had proven her ability to survive and flourish in the tough, competitive world of small business. In addition to running her shop, she was the sole trustee of the Abberwick Foundation, a charitable trust established by her father, the late Jasper Abberwick. Jasper's inventions were the real source of the wealth in the Abberwick family. It was the business of the trust that had brought Molly to Harry a month ago.<br><br>"You don't want to fire me," Harry said.<br><br>"It's the only thing I can do," she retorted. "There's certainly not much point in continuing our association. Nothing is getting done."<br><br>"What, exactly, did you expect from me?"<br><br>Molly threw up her hands in exasperation. "I thought you would be more helpful. More positive. More excited about the various grant proposals. No offense, but waiting for you to approve one is like watching trees grow."<br><br>"I don't do excited. I take a deliberate approach to my work. I thought you understood that. That's why you hired me in the first place."<br><br>"You're deliberate the same way a stone wall is ...</p><h2>Lands of the Curry Leaf: A Vegetarian Food Journey from Sri Lanka to Nepal</h2><p>&#39;A culture of food and friendship flows through my veins. This is the culture of the subcontinent, where a curry leaf tree grows in the garden of just about every home.&#39; Acclaimed chef, author and TV presenter Peter Kuruvita shares over 100 vegetarian and vegan recipes that take us on a culinary journey of discovery through the subcontinent - from Bhutan, Nepal and Afghanistan to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and his home country of Sri Lanka. All the dishes in this deeply personal collection, spiced with the flavours of Peter&#39;s life and travels, reflect the diversity of the regions, their legendary hospitality, their energy and excitement, extraordinary landscapes and rich history. Peter explores a goldmine of plant-based flavours in recipes for street foods; pulses and legumes; salads; dairy-based dishes; curries, stir-fries and stews; rice; soups; chutneys; and sauces. They are supported by detailed glossaries of ingredients, as well as advice on setting up a subcontinental pantry, tempering and blending spices, and adapting authentic regional cooking methods for the home kitchen. This book is a reflection of the changing dialogue about what we eat, as the world embraces the idea of a meal where flesh is not the main event. Lands of the Curry Leaf is a celebration of all things vegetable and their growing prominence at our tables. Showing that vegetables, grains and pulses can be culinary stars, Peter takes simple, honest, health-giving ingredients, adds a host of exciting spices, and transforms them into a complete and joyous meal.</p><p><p>Born in London to an Austrian mother and Sri Lankan father, Peter Kuruvita spent much of his childhood in Sri Lanka before moving to Australia with his parents. Here he began his career as a chef, which has taken him from Sydney to prestigious restaurants in London, the USA, Fiji, the Hayman Islands and Bali. Home in Australia, Peter brings his signature style and focus on seafood to Noosa Beach House on the Sunshine Coast. Memories of an idyllic childhood spent in Sri Lanka inspired his first book, Serendip, published in 2009. This was followed by Peter's first TV series, My Sri Lanka, and by three subsequent TV series: Island Feast, Mexican Fiesta and Peter Kuruvita's Coastal Kitchen. Peter has worked as an ambassador for Dilmah Tea for many years, and also hosts culinary tours of Sri Lanka for World Expeditions.<br> &nbsp;</p></p><h2>Corn</h2><p><b>Popcorn, tortillas, and . . . fuel for cars?

Why does food hold such power? What does the growing commodification and globalization of food mean for our capacity to store the past in our meals in the smell of olive oil or the taste of a fresh-cut fig? </p><p>This book offers a theoretical account of the interrelationship of culture, food and memory. Sutton challenges and expands anthropologys current focus on issues of embodiment, memory and material culture, especially in relation to transnational migration and the flow of culture across borders and boundaries. The Greek island of Kalymnos in the eastern Aegean, where Islanders claim to remember meals long past -- both humble and spectacular provides the main setting for these issues, as well as comparative materials drawn from England and the United States. Despite the growing interest in anthropological accounts of food and in the cultural construction of memory, the intersection of food with memory has not been accorded sustained examination. Cultural practices of feasting and fasting, global flows of food as both gifts and commodities, the rise of processed food and the relationship of orally transmitted recipes to the vast market in speciality cookbooks tie traditional anthropological mainstays such as ritual, exchange and death to more current concerns with structure and history, cognition and the anthropology of the senses. Arguing for the crucial role of a simultaneous consideration of food and memory, this book significantly advances our understanding of cultural processes and reformulates current theoretical preoccupations.</p></p><p>David E.

Of these works, Trager's packs in the most facts, conveyed via relatively lengthy accounts in two-column pages of more than 30,000 events covering all major areas of human endeavor from three million B.C. through 1990. Although the revised edition contains only about 40 more pages than its predecessor, much new material has been added, most obviously for recent years; likewise, much has been cut from the original, most of which will not be missed. The index--justifiably criticized as inadequate in the first edition--has been greatly expanded but remains an imperfect finding device; the 13-line account of Augustus Deodat Taylor's prefabricated house (the so-called "balloon-frame" house), for instance, is not indexed under such logical headings as "architecture," "buildings," "construction," "housing," or "Taylor." Entries in the text are loosely grouped by topic, designated by graphic symbols (dollar sign, artist's palette, mortarboard, etc.), but the symbols tend to be too numerous and ambiguous to serve as effective guides for pinpointing specific information. On balance, Trager's tome succeeds more as a browsing item than as a work for serious reference. Librarians will still prefer the standard, Grun.<br><i>- Kenneth F.

At first Grace revels in reflected Hollywood glamor and her reunion with boyfriend Peter Fox, antiques dealer and former jewel thief. However, although the film&#39;s budget seems boundless, almost no one in the cast or crew seems to have much experience making movies. It&#39;s almost comical...until history begins to repeat itself for real, and then it&#39;s curtains for more than one of the cast.</p><p>Like her protagonist, Killian is a former high school teacher. She is the author of three previous Poetic Death mysteries: High Rhymes and Misdemeanors, Verse of the Vampyre, and Sonnet of the Sphinx, as well as the new Mantra for Murder series. She sings with The Browne Sisters, a Celtic folk group, and lives in Southern California with her husband, Kevin Burton Smith, founder/editor of The Thrilling Detective website.Killian's entertaining fourth mystery to feature Grace Hollister (after 2006's <i>Sonnet of the Sphinx</i>) takes the literary scholar from Los Angeles to England's Lake District, where an adaptation of her memoir, <i>Dangerous to Know</i>, is being filmed for cable TV. After the movie's screenwriter dies in a hit-and-run in L.A., Grace gets hired as a script doctor. She shifts into gumshoe mode on the set after various mishaps, including an actor's poisoning. Might there be a link between the film company's woes and two armed men breaking into the shop of her lover, Peter Fox, a former jewel thief turned antiques dealer? When not busy researching her latest forgotten female poet, Grace investigates the film crew, finding more questions than answers. Meanwhile, misunderstandings between Grace and Peter, as well as a certain local police detective in love with Grace, threaten their relationship. Series fans will eagerly await further developments in the next installment. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She really was a distractingly beautiful girl. He had thought so even when she had first arrived in the king's hall, wet and bedraggled, with her huge-eyed little sister standing beside her.Here in the sunny orchard with the blossoms around her she was the loveliest thing he had ever seen. His father, the poet Amagien, had already written about her looks in extravagant terms. But it was very hard to look at her and deny that her hair was reminiscent of black night or her eyes of stars. She looked like Nive herself come down to walk among men for a season. It was a pity she didn't have wit to match her looks. All she seemed to care about was having everyone adore her. This was the first time she had said something that wasn't directly about herself, and even this wasn't far away. "Always?" he asked."All the time," she confirmed, smiling a little as if she could see something Conal couldn't."What about?" he asked, mildly interested despite himself. He knew she was walking with him only because Ferdia and Darag couldn't be found and she didn't want to walk alone."Everything," she said. "Anything at all. What weapons the three of us should be taught. What color my sister should wear for the Feast of Bel. What crops the farmers should plant and in which fields. Whether the hall needs new rushes yet. If we are to go to war with Muin this summer. If mybrother should marry Atha ap Gren. Who is the father of the white cat's kittens."Conal swallowed hard. He was glad they were alone. He knew that if anyone were to catch his eye at that moment, even Darag, he wouldn't be able to keep himself from laughing aloud. Elenn looked as serious and as beautiful as ever. In the month she had been at Ardmachan she had already reproached him for laughing at her at least a dozen times. "Some of those matters are of great import, and others are very trivial," he said as calmly as possible."I know," Elenn said composedly. "Sometimes they will fight about whether this is the way a king should behave.""My uncle Conary would say that it is not," Conal said definitely. He had heard Conary's lectures on kingship often enough. They were always made to all the royal kin, though it was Darag he always looked at, and Darag whose questions were answered first."My parents have very different ideas about kingship from King Conary," Elenn said, looking up at him under her lashes in a way he would have found enchanting if he could have believed for a minute that she liked him."Which of your parents is the king of Connat anyway?" he asked, realizing that he did not know for sure. "I think I have always heard them mentioned together.""Both of them are of the royal kin," Elenn said. "My mother, Maga, is the daughter of the last king, Arcon. My father, Allel, is her cousin. When the kindred came to choose, many of them wanted Maga, for her wisdom, and others Allel, who was reknown as a warleader when he was young. So it was agreed that they should marry and give each other the benefit of their skills.""And they've been arguing ever since?" Conal asked."Oh, yes," Elenn said. They were almost through the orchard. Conal could already see the oak tree his grandfather used for a school. Emer was there already, pulling a flowerapart intently. Leary and Nid were playing fidchell with leaves in the dust. There was no sign of Darag, or Ferdia and Laig, or of Inis himself. "I think marriage of cousins is very wrong, do not you? I think marriages work better when people know each other much less well to begin with.""No doubt," Conal said politely. Then he thought of his own parents, who had known each other since his father had been fostered here as a boy. "Definitely. But as for your parents, which of them holds the kingship from the land?" he asked. "Only one person can hold it, that I'm sure about." They passed the last of the apple trees and slowed their steps to salute the trees as they passed through the grove."My mother does," Elenn said, bowing to the birch tree. "But it is something else they argue about incessantly. My father says that the kingdom would be nothing if not for his leading armies, and my mother says it would be nothing if not for her alliances.""Are those two paths?" Inis asked.Conal jumped and Elenn gave a little squeal. His grandfather had a habit of doing that and it never failed to disconcert him. Conal tried to be aware of people and movement. Inis was the only person who had managed to surprise him in half a year, but he managed it almost every time. He strove not to let his surprise show on his face or in his movements. Most of a year ago, he had asked Inis for advice on how to deal with Darag, and Inis had told him that he had already learned how. That meant his way of taking things lightly and not showing when he was wounded. He had learned that from his father's constant prodding, not from Darag. He had a shrewd idea that Inis knew that, too. Now he tried to keep his reactions to himself as much as he could, while smiling and speaking airily. He bent his mind to what Inis had said as if it were a riddle he was using to teach them. Were Maga's alliances and Allel's war-leading two paths?"I think you mean that Connat needs both their strengths to be strong, Grandfather," he said, phrasing his answer carefully.Inis looked pleased and began to walk with them towards the others. "Do you see it, girl?" he asked Elenn. She raised her chin affirmatively, but Conal didn't think there was room for much thought behind her pretty face."Where are Ferdia and Darag?" she asked.Most of a month in Oriel and she hadn't learned yet not to ask Inis questions. Not to mention how much that one gave away. Even the order of names revealed her hidden preference, Conal would guess. Elenn had spent most of the month letting Ferdia and Darag act as rivals for her favors, offering each of them the hero's portion in turn, with an occasional shred of meat thrown to Leary and Conal. She hadn't managed to spoil the friendship between Darag and Ferdia. There was no friendship between them and Conal to spoil, even if he had cared, but he hated to watch what it was doing to Leary.Conal had originally thought it might be a good thing for the two princesses of Connat to be fostered with them for a while. He remembered the time he had spent at Cruachan fondly. But he had forgotten the great distance that stretched between ten and seventeen. He would have begged his uncle not to invite them if he had guessed how disruptive rivalry for a beautiful girl could be. Conal realized that Elenn's question had fallen into silence, which meant that his grandfather was looking for the answer across the worlds. Conal turned to him in concern, just in time to see the emptiness in Inis's face before he spoke."Acting on what I taught you this morning," Inis said. His voice sounded different, full of the echoes that meant he was speaking from the depths of his oracle-knowledge. His eyes met Conal's without recognition for a moment.Conal felt disgusted with Elenn for pushing his grandfatheraway from sanity. Then he took in what Inis had said, so suddenly that his head spun. "This morning we were learning how to recognize a fortunate day," he said."And you said that all days were fortunate, but there is an art to telling for what they are fortunate, for some day fortunate for one thing might be unfortunate for another," recited Elenn in a monotone as they came up to the oak tree where the others were sitting."And you read the signs for today and said that it would be a good day for a great warrior to take up arms for the first time," Emer said enthusiastically, jumping up and taking Inis's arm. "Sit down now, sir, and teach us how to read the signs. I could almost see it, but not quite."Inis blinked at the girl, rubbed his eyes and sighed. "You would have made a fine oracle-priest," he said.Emer looked down, smiling."I have to go," Conal said. It had never occurred to him that Darag would have acted on Inis's divination. They were seventeen; it would be a year before any of them could take up arms. A year, which Conal had been counting off by months and days. How could anyone ... how could Darag and Ferdia and Laig have gone off to defy that? He felt stricken. They all spent as much time as they could practicing, but even so, they would not be ready to take up arms until they were eighteen, six threes of years, nobody was. It was a law of Oriel, of the whole island of Tir Isarnagiri, of the whole world as far as Conal knew."I must go too," Elenn said."We must all go," Inis said, sounding as if he knew where he was again. "I have acted without thought." He hesitated, looking from Emer to Conal, then he sighed. "Come back to the dun, we must see the king.""What? All of us? Why?" Nid looked up from her game for the first time, pushing her hair out of her eyes."Darag has gone to take up arms," Elenn explained to them.Nid and Leary exchanged a startled glance, then got to their feet as Inis gestured to them. Then, without looking, he put out his hands and held back Emer and Conal, one on each side of him, and let the others go ahead. Leary and Nid at once flanked Elenn, one on each side, Leary offering her shy compliments. She did not so much as glance back at Conal.Inis sighed again as he held Conal back. "I did wrong, but I could not have done other; so I did in all the worlds.""You said in 'all the worlds,' ap Fathag," Emer said. "I don't understand how it would be possible to know without looking into every world there is."Conal grinned at her behind Inis's back. That was the way to ask Inis questions if you wanted information out of him. Conal hadn't taken much notice of Emer before. She was a year younger than the rest of them, only sixteen. She'd just gone through a growing spurt and seemed all eyes and legs. She hadn't caused disruption among the rest of them the way her sister had. He'd been concentrating on Elenn, and Darag, of course. But now it seemed that unlike her beautiful sister, Emer had more wit than hair."Some events have such weight that they cannot be changed," Inis said. "Most times we are free to choose, and if folk choose the same in other worlds, it is because they are much the same folk and so choice arises. But some things touch the way the worlds are held together and with them, it feels like choice but is not."Conal frowned, wishing this riddle made sense. Emer drew breath to speak, let it out, drew it in again. "I don't think I can tell the difference between those events and any others," she said.Inis laughed, the laugh Conal's mother Finca called his cracked cackle. Elenn and the others ahead turned to look,but Conal gestured them on and they started walking again."If I cannot tell after all these years of looking across the worlds, then how can you hope to, child?" he asked. "Being able to tell is part of what an oracle-priest must know. I cannot tell until afterwards, and that is only the second such time in my life.""It would be very interesting to know the other time," Conal said.Inis grinned at him, looking almost like any old man, except for the way his head was shaved in the front and the brightly colored shawl that would have marked him as an oracle-priest however sane he seemed. "It was when I got Conary on King Nessa," he said.It was such an ancient scandal, from so long before Conal was born, that he was surprised to see Emer look shocked. Maybe it wasn't well known in Connat. Conal's parents didn't like to talk about it, but all the same, he had known since he was five years old."If only two events in all your length of life have been of such stature as to hold across all the worlds, then maybe there will be none in mine," Emer said."Such are lucky folk," Inis said. "And such are most folk, truth told. But I do not think either of you are so lucky.""I know better than to ask," Conal said, looking ahead through the trees to where Elenn inclined towards Leary. They were holding hands. Nid had gone a little way ahead. "You know, Grandfather, though my mind is quick for the branches of learning, and though I love you, I hate learning from you. I have always learned songs and figuring fast enough, but this Oak Knowledge of learning to read luck and the way of other worlds makes my skin crawl. I don't even like thinking about it.""You know the story of Curog the Oracle-priest?" Inis asked. "He prophesied that a certain lady would win the love of a certain lord. When the lord died, the lady came to himand reproached him for being wrong, for he had never loved her. Then Curog said that in the worlds he could see, where he had not spoken, she had acted to win his love and won it, but in our world, she had been sure she would win it without acting, and so nothing came of it."Inis said no more. Conal glanced at Emer, who was frowning at nothing. They walked in silence for a while. Conal started running through arguments he would make to Conary. It was hideously unfair to let Darag and Ferdia take up arms early and on a fortunate day, and not the rest of them. But Conary always favored Darag of all his nephews. There were good reasons for that, of course. Though Conal was good, Darag was better. But Conal was sure that if he put in more effort, more time practicing, building up his strength, he would eventually catch up and even overtake Darag. Being strong and fast as a boy was nothing, what counted was when you were men. Even his father said so. If Darag had taken up arms today, then Conal would do the same, that's all there was to it. Anything else was unthinkable.When they came out of the orchard, Elenn, Leary, and Nid were waiting for them at the foot of the mound. Nid was swinging on the gate. The bottom palisade was no ring of sharpened stakes but a tall fence of strong bog-oak, the oak that could break an iron ax. No enemies had ever breached it. No enemies were expected today however, which was fortunate as there was nobody guarding the lower gate."We thought we'd wait for you slowpokes," Leary said, sticking out his tongue at Conal. Conal smiled as if amused at how childish boys of seventeen could be, hiding all the pain. Leary had been his friend. They had always practiced together, each of them hoping to become as good as Darag. Now Leary hardly spoke to him except to jibe."It is unkind to mock my old bones, Grandson," Inis saidsharply. Leary jumped. He was used to the old man not paying any attention. Conal kept his face still, to show nothing.Inis let go of Conal's arm, and then, a moment later, Emer's. He led a brisk pace past the stables and up the hill towards the dun. Here, where Conal would have guessed he'd want support, he decided to do without it. The rest of them followed him in a straggle, Conal first, quickening his pace, and Emer beside him. "I didn't know Leary was ap Fathag's grandson as well," Emer said quietly."You're getting really good at not asking questions," Conal said and smiled at her. This time, she smiled back, shyly, not at all like her sister. "But it's all right to ask me. Inis had four children. My mother, Leary's mother and Darag's mother by his wife, and Conary by King Nessa as he just told us.""I had heard before,"...</p><h2>The Vulture Investors: The Winners and Losers of the Great American Bankruptcy Feeding Frenzy</h2><p>A look at vulture investors--the investors who capitalize on bankruptcy by feeding on businesses in trouble--presents anecdotes on such big-time investors as Mary Whiteman, revealing their secret dealings and schemes. 20,000 first printing. National ad/promo.</p><p>"What kinds of investors actually choose to make their living by seeking out troubled companies and becoming mired in the complexities and contentiousness of a bankruptcy or out-of-court workout?" - Hilary Rosenberg (from The Vulture Investors)<br> <br> Welcome to the big-time, big-stress-and big-profit-world of vulture investing. From the eleventh-hour save of Donald Trump's casinos, to the tempestuous history of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel, to the rocky restructuring of the massive Revco discount drugstore chain, Hilary Rosenberg takes us on a fast-moving journey through some of the major bankruptcies of the 1980s and 1990s-and brings to life the infamous, talented arbiters at the heart of their recovery. Meet the so-called "vulture investors" who cast their sights on distressed concerns, buy out debt, and skillfully forge their way to rich returns. Quietly upstaging the flashier corporate tycoons and raiders of the previous decade, men like Leon Black, Ronald LaBow, Sam Zell, Talton Embry, and Martin Whitman have helped to make a more efficient market in this obscure sector of investment, and their success may even inspire the quickly evolving business cultures of Asia and Latin America.<br> <br> The vulture investors made their way to the forefront of American business during the troubled period when declaring bankruptcy became commonplace among debt-heavy companies. Buying out debt and seeing through the rehabilitation of companies as well-known as Sunbeam and Bloomingdale's, these unique players have changed the face of the distressed securities market. In her own animated, absorbing, and original style, Hilary Rosenberg creates thoroughly researched reenactments of the vultures' greatest exploits to offer an intriguing examination of their methods and their madness-and reveals the important role of these controversial characters in aiding worldwide economic recovery.<br> <br> Praise for The Vulture Investors<br> <br> "A lively account of the hardy band of investors who look for-and find-gold in capitalism's junk pile. Rosenberg not only tells their stories with captivating relish but weighs the overall economic impact of their exploits. This book is a valuable introduction to 1990s-style deal-making." - Chris Welles, Senior Editor, Business Week<br> <br> "In a tour de force of punchy business writing, Rosenberg dissects a little-known but increasingly common high-stakes financial game: preying on companies in distress. . . . The author relates these intricate, suspenseful narratives in a clear, lively style that always instructs and often amuses." - Publishers Weekly<br> <br> "Reads like a good suspense novel." - Library JournalHilary Rosenberg has written for the New York Times, Business Week, Institutional Investor, Barron&#39;s, and Financial World.

He is remembered chiefly for his work on &#34;Doctor Who&#34;, as well as his contributions to many popular television series of the era.Geoffrey Beevers&#39;s narration of this 1974 serial shows how well the Doctor stands the test of time. Time, of course, is the center of the adventure in DOCTOR WHO, and here the Doctor and his assistant, Jo Grant, inadvertently travel to 2471. They become embroiled in a dispute between a band of colonists and a greedy mining company (and become party to the unknown motivations of the Master). Unlike many Doctor Who audio productions, this is a single-voice narrative, but Beevers does an outstanding job of making it sound like many voices are at work. There are minimal music and sound effects, but the narrative hardly needs them. For new and loyal fans alike, this is Doctor Who at his finest.

Creation, he shows, is not simply "reality." He exhumes a more concrete, dynamic, pluralistic sense of creation, with accents on interdependence, unrest, and the text's "astounding potential for critique of deeply ingrained conceptions and ways of thinking." Welker then sketches surprising and creative interpretations of the text's most perplexing features: the angelic world, the image of God in humans, domination, sin and "the fall." </p><p>Opening new alternatives in biblical theology, philosophy, and religion and science, Welker's approach allows the novel and discordant strains in the biblical text to sound again.</p></p><p>&#34;Michael Welker returns to the most elemental issues in the biblical theme of creator/creation and rethinks from the ground up the vexed and urgent issues of revelation, creation ex nihilo, domination, and &#34;the fall.&#34; Welker effectively links these great questions to the current cultural crisis of the West. Along the way he makes clear beyond any doubt why even systematic theologians must always again resume the task of exegesis. Creation and Reality is an important contribution to the dramatic overhaul of theological categories now required for faithful reading.&#34; ---Walter Brueggemann Columbia Theological SeminaryMichael Welker is Professor of Systematic Theology at the University of Heidelberg, Germany.

These exhibitions offered startled viewers an early version of installation art before the form existed as such. In <i>Displaying the Marvelous</i>, Lewis Kachur explores this development by analyzing three elaborate Surrealist installations created between 1938 and 1942. The first two, the "Exposition Internationale du Surrealisme" (1938) and the "Dream of Venus" at the New York World's Fair (1939), dealt with the fetishization of the female body. The third, "First Papers of Surrealism" (1942), focused not on the figure but on the entire expanse of the exhibition space, thus contributing to the development of nonfigurative art in New York. Kachur presents a full visual and verbal reconstruction of each of the exhibitions, evoking the sequence that the contemporary viewer would have encountered.<br> <br> The book considers Marcel Duchamp and Salvador Dali, two artists who are not usually compared, within a common framework. Duchamp specialized in frustrating the spectator, using his ironic wit to call into question the definition of the work of art. Dali was a master at disorienting the senses by establishing and then undermining everyday spatial and object properties. The Surrealist challenge, as voiced by Andre Breton, was to evoke the marvelous. Duchamp and Dali extended that challenge to the physical and commercial realm of the exhibition installation.</p><p>Lewis Kachur is Associate Professor of Art History at Kean University, New Jersey.<br> Recently, Lewis Kachur has had two Marcel Duchamp-related conference proposals accepted for presentation at national venues in the coming academic year:<br> <br> <i>Naming and Embodying the Rose,</i> Modern Language Association, Los Angeles, January 7, 2011.<br> <br> <i>Dirtying the Corner: Duchamp, Rauschenberg and Surrealist Exhibition Interiors</i>, Surrealism and the Americas Conference, Rice University, Houston, forthcoming Nov. 6, 2010."Kachur's account is a valuable contribution to the reception history of modern art in American popular culture."<br> &#x2014; <b>Sheldon Nodelman</b>, <i>Art in America</i><br><br>"A compulsive and beautifully presented read..<br> &#x2014; <b>David Gove Surman</b>, <i>Leonardo</i><br><br>"Unique and perceptive research...a remarkable and insightful narrative of installation art's beginnings."<br> &#x2014; <b>Petra Rigby Watson</b>, <i>Parachute</i><br><br>"Anyone specializing in the history of Surrealism or the history of installation art will find this book essential reading."<br> &#x2014; <b>John A.

This beautiful book--the program's companion volume--describes the dramatic chain of events that will ultimately send human beings to Mars. The story begins in ancient times when the red planet was associated with war and violence, then leads us to the American astronomer Percival Lowell. He trained his telescope on our neighboring red planet and detected surface marks that he and other observers believed were canals. Both the book and the TV account proceed to the present day, describing NASA's series of unmanned landings, then continuing into the future, dramatizing events in the course of the projected Martian mission. The TV series will be shown in two main sections: <br> <br> <b> Race to Mars </b> summarizes the science-based fictional docudrama, a four-hour miniseries to be pres/ented on two separate evenings<br><b> Mars Rising </b> summarizes the TV documentary, to be presented as six one-hour shows <br> <br> This book's magnificent illustrations include many of the high-quality photos taken by satellites and recent surface probes of Mars. Its additional illustrations include state-of-the-art visuals created especially for the TV series by author Dana Berry.

In <i> Race to Mars, </i> Dana Berry chronicles their harrowing and exciting journey. The story begins with astronomers and dreamers, leads to the work of engineers and physicists, and ends with the astonishing achievement of the crew members who risk their lives to extend the reach of humankind to another world. <br> <br> (front flap) <br> <b> Is there life on Mars? </b> <br> <br> People have long suspected that there might be. The nineteenth-century Milanese astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli first drew attention to the <i> canali </i> on the planet�&#x2019;s surface. An American, Percival Lowell, after studying Schiaparelli�&#x2019;s maps, became convinced that there was an alien civilization slowly dying there. His books in turn inspired the classic novel by H.G. Wells and a profusion of movies based on the premise laid out in Wells�&#x2019; <i> The War of the Worlds. </i> Martians have inhabited our collective imagination for more than a hundred years. <br> <br> There are good reasons for our fascination. Of all the planets in our solar system, Mars is most like Earth. It has seasons, as Earth does. Although colder than Earth, the temperatures on Mars are within a range that humans might endure. And latest findings by NASA indicate the presence of water on Mars. The presence of water raises the possibility that life also exists. <br> <br> A journey to Mars is no longer a dream. Dana Berry draws on his wide experience as a science writer �&#x2014; and on research developed for the television docudrama Race to Mars �&#x2014; to describe the work already underway to take humans to the Red Planet. He describes the complex operation that leads to the construction in low Earth orbit of the Terra Nova spacecraft that will carry the six-person crew to Mars. He examines the nature of the risks �&#x2014; from mechanical failure and fire to physical and psychological breakdown �&#x2014; that the crew will have to overcome. And he writes about the experiments that will be conducted when Earth�&#x2019;s first human emissaries set foot on Martian soil. <br> <br> (back flap) <br> <i> Race to Mars </i> features spectacular computer-generated images created especially for the Mars television series �&#x2014; along with latest breathtaking photographs of the planet captured by NASA. <br> <br> <b>Dana Berry, </b>a writer, artist, and pioneering computer animator, is the author of New Cosmos: An Intimate Guide to the Latest Discoveries in Space.

(Getting to Know the World's Greatest Artists Series). CIP. Childrens. 1988. PLB $9.95. Grade 1-3 Despite the current trend to introduce music, literature, and art to very young children, these books serve to illustrate the limitations of such efforts. Here the lives and works of two brilliant and revolutionary painters have been reduced to a series of basic facts and cliches. Children reading these books will get less biographic information than could be found in an encyclopedia and no insight into the unique vision and talent that made these artists important. Venezia's analysis of the artists' style is simplistiche attributes Picasso's blue period to depression over the death of a friend and his rose period to a new love. He makes no attempt to explain the principals of Cubism, focusing on the peculiarities of the images rather than the ideas behind them. His treatment of Rembrandt's work is equally shallow, describing the objects pictured rather than the artist's interpretation. Although he mentions the variety of brush strokes in one Rembrandt painting, he spends more time pointing out the spilled glasses of wine in the painting and never mentions Rembrandt's signature use of light and shadow or the richness and warmth of his color. In addition to reproductions of the paintings, captioned cartoons illustrate the text. The combination of jokes and simplicity creates an overall sense of condescension. Those wishing to introduce children to the works of these artists should wait until they are old enough for Ernest Raboff's fine biographic interpretation (Lippincott). Eleanor K.

And, when Albert Speer was captured and sentenced at Nuremberg--after becoming the only defendant to plead guilty--he started keeping this secret diary, much of it on toilet paper. After 20 years of imprisonment, he found 25,000 of the smuggled pages waiting for him, and from those entries he shaped this deeply powerful document. "Albert Speer's book is a deeply moving document. It is also of extraordinary political and psychological interest...a must for anyone interested in psychological motivation of political action and the problem of guilt and repentance. But, beyond this it is so fascinatingly written that I could not put it down before I finished it." --<i>Erich Fromm</i>.<br></p><p>Albert Speer (March 19, 1905 &#x2013; September 1, 1981) was a German architect who was, for part of World War II, Minister of Armaments and War Production for the Third Reich. Speer was Adolf Hitler's chief architect before assuming ministerial office. As "the Nazi who said sorry", he accepted responsibility at the Nuremberg trials and in his memoirs for crimes of the Nazi regime. His level of involvement in the persecution of the Jews and his level of knowledge of the Holocaust remain matters of dispute. As Hitler's Minister of Armaments and War Production, Speer was so successful that Germany's war production continued to increase despite massive and devastating Allied bombing. After the war, he was tried at Nuremberg and sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the Nazi regime, principally for the use of forced labour. He served his full sentence, most of it at Spandau Prison in West Berlin. Following his release from Spandau in 1966, Speer published two bestselling autobiographical works, Inside the Third Reich and Spandau: The Secret Diaries, detailing his often close personal relationship with Hitler, and providing readers and historians with a unique perspective within the workings of the Nazi regime. He later wrote a third book, Infiltration, about the SS. Speer died of natural causes in 1981 while on a visit to London.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Rocketeer: Hollywood Horror (The Rocketeer)</h2><p><ul> <li>Missing scientists!

The map may be found by searching for the new product ISBN: 9781931257497 Thank You.</b></p><p>STREETWISE� is the first map to be designed with modern graphics and is the originator of the laminated, accordion-fold map format. We&#x2019;ve set the standard that every map company has imitated but never duplicated. Our mission is to make you feel comfortable, to make you feel safe in a place where you&#x2019;ve never been before and to enable you to experience a familiar place more fully.<p>The company was founded in 1984 by Michael Brown, who had been in international publishing for many years, setting up subsidiaries for textbook publishers. In the 1970&#x2019;s, Brown traveled extensively throughout Africa, India, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Brown would take a large paper map, cut out the city center, folded it up and slip it into his pocket, thus preventing him from looking like a tourist in areas where discretion is the better part of travel. This was his tool for surviving.</p><p>After many years on the road, Brown settled back in New York and decided to start his own business, based on the adaptations he had made to maps in his travels. His goal was to give someone the ability to navigate easily in unfamiliar terrain.</p><p>He started with a new map format: the accordion fold. Such a simple idea, but at the time it was revolutionary. No more struggling to fold an awkward, oversized paper map. This new format would enable the user to blend in like a native, instead of stick out like a tourist. Brown then added lamination to ensure that the map would be a lasting tool.</p><p>More important than the format was the design of the map itself. It had to be a map that not only succeeded above and beyond any map he had used, but was esthetically appealing as well. The look of it had to be as striking as the functionality. Color was introduced in a way that was never seen before in a map - vivid purple for water, soothing gray for the background of street grids, gold to highlight elements of the map. Clarity, conciseness and convenience in a very stylish package.</p><p>Building the business was a 24 hour job. Brown sold the maps during the day, zipping around Manhattan making deliveries on his Harley Davidson. At night he packed the orders and did the design work. More titles were added, each title requiring months of research and design.</p><p>Today, STREETWISE� produces over 130 titles for major destinations, regions and countries throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom and Asia. We have grown from the back of a motorcycle to selling millions of maps around the world.</p><p>Yet each title is still painstakingly researched and updated. STREETWISE� is one of the only, if not THE only map company that conducts research by walking or driving an area to ensure accuracy. After all, what good is the map if what you hold in your hands doesn&#x2019;t match what you see on the street sign? This lengthy fact checking results in superior accuracy; in effect, we&#x2019;ve done the work, now you have the adventure.</p><p>In the end, it&#x2019;s not about the map, it&#x2019;s about getting out and finding your own authentic experience wherever you go. It&#x2019;s about being in a city or a region and discovering things that you never thought you would find. You can do this if you have confidence and you have confidence if you have a great map. STREETWISE� is the great map that you need.</p>'Don't leave home without STREETWISE.' --<b>The New York Times</b><br><br>'STREETWISE is an absolute travel essential.' --<b>Travel + Leisure Magazine</b><br><br>'In a strange city, your sense of direction is only as good as the map in your hands.

Formerly a radio astronomer at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, he is cosmology consultant for NEW SCIENTIST<i></i>. His books include WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD, QUANTUM THEORY CANNOT HURT YOU and WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KELVIN, which was shortlisted for the 2010 Royal Society Book Prize. He is also the author of the app SOLAR SYSTEM FOR iPAD, which won THE BOOKSELLER<i></i>Digital Innovation of the Year award.

And he has also performed stand-up comedy at a variety of venues from an upturned inflatable cow on London's South Bank to a glass-bottomed boat in a shark tank at the Brighton Sealife Centre.Chown&#39;s fascinating guide to the force of gravity follows its story from Newton to the as yet undiscovered quantum theory of gravity - the holy grail of 21st-century physics. He concludes that the greatest questions in science (Where did the universe come from? What are space and time?) are tantalisingly close to being answered -- Jane Shilling * DAILY MAIL &#39;Must Read&#39; * Timely and accessible, this history of something we all feel but still cannot quite grasp has an admirably light touch. -- Rob Kingston * The Sunday Times (Culture) * Timely, accessible and peppered with quotes from Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett, this history of something we all feel but still cannot quite grasp has an admirably light touch * THE SUNDAY TIMES &#39;Science Book of the Year&#39; * A helter-skelter tour through the lives and discoveries of people who helped us understand gravity .. fascinating facts ... he gives us the clearest explanation I have yet read of Einstein&#39;s principle of relativity ... this book taught me science and science history in an engaging fashion ...

He shows how Isaac Newton&#39;s 1687 Principia - which distilled fundamental laws from the complexity of the cosmos - helps to explain phenomena such as tides.

Even Clifford's religious affiliations get cleared up: the BRD is decidedly gentile, as he celebrates both Christmas and Easter, albeit in a pretty hands-off, nondenominational way. </p><p> Bridwell's time-honored dog tales don't exactly rely on unpredictability for their charm (they're funny because he's <i>big</i>), and this collection is no exception. But if you love Clifford--or you love someone else who loves Clifford--you can't go wrong getting in on the big guy's celebrations.

WHICHER</h2><p>In June of 1860 three-year-old Saville Kent was found at the bottom of an outdoor privy with his throat slit. The crime horrified all England and led to a national obsession with detection, ironically destroying, in the process, the career of perhaps the greatest detective in the land.<p>At the time, the detective was a relatively new invention; there were only eight detectives in all of England and rarely were they called out of London, but this crime was so shocking that Scotland Yard sent its best man to investigate, Inspector Jonathan Whicher. </p>Whicher quickly believed the unbelievable&#x2014;that someone within the family was responsible for the murder of young Saville Kent. Without sufficient evidence or a confession, though, his case was circumstantial and he returned to London a broken man. Though he would be vindicated five years later, the real legacy of Jonathan Whicher lives on in fiction: the tough, quirky, knowing, and all-seeing detective that we know and love today: from the cryptic Sergeant Cuff in Wilkie Collins&#x2019;s <i>The Moonstone </i>to Dashiell Hammett&#x2019;s Sam Spade. <p><i>The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher </i>is a provocative work of nonfiction that reads like a Victorian thriller, and in it author Kate Summerscale has fashioned a brilliant, multilayered narrative that is as cleverly constructed as it is beautifully written. </p></p><p>KATE SUMMERSCALE is the former literary editor for the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> and author of <i>The Queen of Whale Cay</i>, which won the Somerset Maugham Award and was shortlisted for the Whitbread biography award.

In a newly uncertain world, a detective seemed to offer science, conviction, stories that could organise chaos. He turned brutal crimes&#x2014;the vestiges of the beast in man&#x2014;into intellectual puzzles. He was a secular substitute for a prophet or a priest. Yet the Victorians also made a fetish of privacy, and many felt that the investigation at Road Hill amounted to a violation of the middle-class home. Mr Whicher exposed the corruptions within the household: sexual transgression, emotional cruelty, scheming servants, wayward children, insanity, jealousy, loneliness and loathing. The scene he uncovered aroused fear (and excitement) at the thought of what might be hiding behind the closed doors of other respectable houses. His conclusions helped to create an era of voyeurism and suspicion, in which the detective was a shadowy figure, a demon as well as a demigod.</i></p><h2>Gosta Berling&#39;s Saga</h2><p>The first woman to receive the Nobel Prize for literature, Lagerl�f assured her place in Swedish letters with this 1891 novel.

The result: ill-advised eating and lifestyle habits that leave us vulnerable to all manner of disease&#x2014;not to mention unwanted flab, premature wrinkling and a sagging, weak, unattractive body. The first step is to break the chains of our current eating habits. The Warrior Diet proves that humans are at their energetic, physical, mental and passionate best when they "undereat" during the day and "overeat" at night. Once you master this essential eating cycle, a new life of explosive vigor, good looks and vitality will be yours for the taking. </p><p>Not just a diet, but a whole way of life, The Warrior Diet encourages us to seize back the pleasures of being alive&#x2014;from the most refined to the wild and raw. The Warrior Diet is practical, tested, and based in commonsense. Expect results!</p></p><p>Ori Hofmekler is a modern Renaissance man whose life has been driven by two passions: art and sports. Hofmekler&#x2019;s formative experience as a young man with the Israeli Special Forces, prompted a lifetime&#x2019;s interest in diets and fitness regimes that would optimize his physical and mental performance. <p>After the army, Ori attended the Bezalel Academy of Art and the Hebrew University, where he studied art and philosophy and received a degree in Human Sciences. </p><p>A world-renowned painter, best known for his controversial political satire, Ori&#x2019;s work has been featured in magazines worldwide, including Time, Newsweek, Rolling Stone, People, The New Republic as well as Penthouse where he was a monthly columnist for 17 years and Health Editor from 1998&#x2013;2000. Ori has published two books of political art, Hofmekler&#x2019;s People, and Hofmekler&#x2019;s Gallery. </p><p>As founder, Editor-In-Chief, and Publisher of Mind &amp; Muscle Power, a national men&#x2019;s health and fitness magazine, Ori introduced his Warrior Diet to the public in a monthly column&#x2014;to immediate acclaim from readers and professionals in the health industry alike.</p><p>For the Greco-Roman soldier wannabe, this modified fasting program from a former member of the Israeli Special Forces is similar to weight builders' "animalbolics" diet. Forget calorie counting. Instead, Hofmekler suggests that we return to our bodies' instinctive eating style, "undereating" during the day and "overeating" at night. He recommends eating a daily main meal in the evening, with no caloric restrictions (light snacking on fresh fruits and vegetables is okay during the day, as is eating small amounts of lean protein). According to the author, this burns fat, builds muscles, accelerates metabolism, and slows aging. Short, intense strength and aerobic exercises (illustrated) are also part of the "warrior training," along with pre-and post-workout meals. Alluring though the "warrior" image may be, it seems unrealistic to expect most men especially the 40-plus who would most benefit to stick with this plan for a lifetime. </p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Slow Man</h2><p>A masterful new novel from one of the greatest writers alive.<br><br>Paul Rayment is on the threshold of a comfortable old age when a calamitous cycling accident results in the amputation of a leg. Humiliated, his body truncated, his life circumscribed, he turns away from his friends.<br><br>He hires a nurse named Marijana, with whom he has a European childhood in common: hers in Croatia, his in France. Tactfully and efficiently she ministers to his needs. But his feelings for her, and for her handsome teenage son, are complicated by the sudden arrival on his doorstep of the celebrated Australian novelist Elizabeth Costello, who threatens to take over the direction of his life and the affairs of his heart.<br><br>Unflinching in its vision of suffering and generous in its portrayal of the spirit of care, <b>Slow Man</b> is a masterful work of fiction by one of the world&#x2019;s greatest writers.</p><p>J. M. Coetzee&#x2019;s work includes <b>Waiting For The Barbarians</b>, <b>Life &amp; Times of Michael K</b>, <b>Boyhood: Scenes From Provincial Life</b>, <b>Youth</b>, <b>Disgrace</b> and, most recently, <b>Elizabeth Costello</b>. He was the first author to win the Booker Prize twice and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2003.Nobel-winner Coetzee (<i>Disgrace</i>) ponders life, love and the mind/ body connection in his latest heavy-hitter; he also plays a little trick. When retired photographer Paul Rayment loses his leg in a bicycle accident, his lengthy, lonely recuperation forces him to reflect on a life he deems wasted. The gloom lifts with the arrival of brisk, efficient Marijana Jokic, his Croatian day nurse, with whom Paul becomes infatuated. (He also takes a special interest in Marijana's teenage boy&#x2014;the son he never had.) It's here, while Paul frets over how to express his feelings, that Coetzee (perhaps unsure if his dithering protagonist can sustain the book) gets weird: the distinguished writer Elizabeth Costello, eponymous heroine of Coetzee's 2003 novel, comes for a visit. To Paul's bewilderment, Costello (Coetzee's alter ego?) exhorts him to become more of a main character in the narrative, even orchestrating events to force his reactions. Some readers will object to this cleverness and the abstract forays into the mysteriousness of the writing process. It is to Coetzee's credit, however, a testament to his flawless prose and appealing voice, that while challenging the reader with postmodern shenanigans, the story of how Paul will take charge of his life and love continues to engage, while Elizabeth Costello the device softens into a real character, one facing frailties of her own. She pushes Paul, or Paul pushes Elizabeth&#x2014;both push Coetzee&#x2014;on to the bittersweet conclusion. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With each nation that falls before their murderous onslaught, the marauders draw closer to Merovence, where good Queen Alisande rules with the help of her husband, Royal Wizard Matt Mantrell.<br><br>Now Matt and Alisande receive an urgent call for help from Jerusalem-- destined to be the barbarians' next target. But when Matt arrives in the Holy City to assess the imminent threat, he makes a shocking discovery: The power-mad khan who rules the ravaging minions is in league with a far greater and more dreadful enemy! With the aid of his old ally the djinn princess, a giant talking bird, and a fledgling enchantress with the power to change into a cat, Matt must call upon every resource, magical and mortal, to defy the triumph of pure evil . . .</p><p>Christopher Stasheff spent his early childhood in Mount Vernon, New York, but lived the rest of his formative years in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He has always had difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality and tried to compromise by teaching college. When teaching proved too real, he gave it up in favor of writing full-time. He tends to pre-script his life but doesn&#39;t understand why other people can&#39;t get their lines right.The royal family was enjoying one of the rare hours when they could feel like a family. They sat in the palace garden in a secluded and high-hedged corner of the courtyard, Queen Alisande and her husband the Lord Wizard watching their son and daughter at play in the golden light of late afternoon.<br><br>"It is so good for them to be out of doors," Alisande sighed, "and with us. I could wish I were not a queen, that I could spend hours and hours with my babes if I wished."<br><br>"If you weren't a queen, you wouldn't have any choice," Matt pointed out. <br><br>"You'd have to spend hours and hours with them, whether you wanted to or not."<br><br>"Oh ... not if I were a countess or some such ..."<br><br>"Well, that's true," Matt mused. "On the other hand, this country would be in real trouble if you weren't its queen."<br><br>"Oh, I am sure some other could rule it as well." But Alisande glowed at the compliment, then frowned. "Still, the poor babes must be quite sad now and again, with no company but one another."<br><br>"A pet," Matt said positively. "They need a pet."<br><br>"A pet?" Alisande stared, astounded. "A prince and princess, with an animal?"<br><br>"A family dog, to teach them responsibility and consideration."<br><br>"How could a dog teach consideration?"<br><br>"Because you have to be careful about its feelings," Matt explained. "If you pull its tail too hard, it lets you know about it in no uncertain terms--and if you do it too often, it won't come back to play. It doesn't care whether the child is a prince or a beggar, you see."<br><br>"Might it not bite?" Alisande said in apprehension.<br><br>"It has to be very well-trained," Matt explained, "and training it helps the children train themselves."<br><br>"A princess?" Alisande shuddered, and turned back to watch the children. <br><br>"Whoever heard of such a thing?"<br><br>"Oh, I've noticed you seem to have a certain fondness for horses," Matt pointed out, "and you get along quite well with hounds."<br><br>"Well ... yes, but that is in the hunt!" Alisande explained. "Assuredly, every prince and princess must learn to ride--but the grooms care for the horses and the houndsmen for the dogs. We do not make pets of our packs, and would scarcely keep a horse within doors!"<br><br>"Well, no," Matt admitted. "I had in mind something smaller--a nice, friendly, clumsy dog, maybe--a poodle or a retriever or something like that."<br><br>Alisande still looked scandalized, but she tried to be reasonable. "How would such a beast teach the children to be responsible?"<br><br>"By caring for it," Matt said. "Make it clear to them that nobody else is going to feed it or take it for a walk, because it's theirs. Simply having an animal that belongs to them will do wonders for their sense of self-worth, too--and it's great company if a child feels lonely."<br><br>"Royal children do feel alone quite often." Alisande lifted her head, gazing into her own past. "They have no playmates but their kin, and those seldom come ..." She shook herself. "But to feed and water an animal? That is scarcely becoming to their rank!"<br><br>"It is, if nobody else is allowed to touch the royal pup," Matt pointed out.<br><br>Alisande still looked thoughtful, but she said, "A dog is too dirty and awkward a beast to keep within doors. A cat, now, would be another matter."<br><br>"Cats are better than nothing," Matt allowed, "but they don't need to be walked, and you can't train them, so they won't make you any more responsible than you are already. They won't come keep you company whenever you want them, either--they have this nasty little habit of only stopping by when they want company."<br><br>"But they are smaller, and more graceful," Alisande pointed out, "far less likely to break a vase or a pitcher, and far better suited to life within doors."<br><br>"I had in mind a small dog," Matt said, "maybe a spaniel or a Scots terrier, something that can sit in your lap and be petted."<br><br>"Like a cat?" Alisande smiled. "Then why not have a cat?"<br><br>"Well, the dog can jump out of your lap and run to fetch a ball," Matt said. <br><br>"It can play games with you."<br><br>"And bring the ball back in its mouth, and slobber all over it as the child picks it up?" Alisande shuddered. "Cats play games, too, by chasing bits of string. They are far less disgusting."<br><br>"Well, I would prefer a dog," Matt said, "but I'll settle for a cat. When shall we go find one?"<br><br>"Now, hold!" Alisande cried. "I have not said we shall have a pet! Only that if we do, it should be a cat!"<br><br>"Okay, so think about it for a few days," Matt said. "It's really a good idea, though. Why, I've even heard of a king who kept a dog in his lap when he was on the throne!" He didn't mention that Louis XIV had reigned in a world three hundred years older than Alisande's.<br><br>"We might set a fashion," Alisande admitted, her gaze on the children. "I shall consider it."<br><br>Kaprin suddenly gave his little sister a shove. She rolled back, squalling, then bounced up with a block in her chubby hand. She threw it with all her three-year-old might and very precocious accuracy; it hit her brother on the nose. He recoiled, hand to the offended member, squalling protest, then started toward her with blood in his eye.<br><br>"Children!" Alisande started up.<br><br>The nursemaid was there before her, though, separating the two children and chiding them equally. "For shame, Alice! Scold sharply if you will, but do not throw things! And you, Kaprin--you know full well that no gentleman should ever strike a lady!"<br><br>"I'm not a gentleman yet," the six-year-old grumbled.<br><br>"That is no excuse."<br><br>"There might be some advantage to a pet, after all," Alisande allowed.<br><br>"Just don't think it over for too long," Matt said.<br><br>The question was about to be answered for them, but it was an answer that had been growing for sixteen years. It began far to the east, in a northern valley nestled among the hills on the edge of the Gobi Desert. It began in the midst of chaos, but the setting was quite peaceful--for a few minutes.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The Oriental garden seemed magical in the moonlight, air fragrant with the perfume of exotic blossoms and stirred by a breeze, which rustled the leaves of flowering trees grown into fanciful shapes by patient gardeners over dozens of years. Wind chimes filled the night with music. The turquoise lawn seemed deep green in the moonlight, bejeweled with dew. Topiary shrubs in sculpted forms framed an ivory gazebo of ornate screens.<br><br>So lovely a garden should have lain tranquil under the moon, its only sound the susurrus of leaves and the tinkling of the brook that ran through it, turning model mill wheels and tugging at miniature boats moored for the night at tiny, fanciful boathouses.<br><br>It would be tranquil and still for a few minutes more, granting an illusion of peace and safety. But then, behind the scented trees, flames would roar high into the sky from the burning barracks of the horse-soldiers, and the breeze would blow the screams of horses and people alike through the garden, together with the roar and clangor of battle.<br><br>A woman hurried across the lawn, the train of her silken robe trailing across the dew-laden grass, her long sleeves sweeping almost as low. She held a small chest in her arms, and when she reached the brook, knelt down and lowered it into the water.<br><br>Lifting the lid, she took one last look at the little face of a six-month-old baby wrapped in a cloth-of-gold blanket, asleep from the drop of opium mixed into her milk.<br><br>The woman's eyes filled with tears. "Lie there, my treasure," she whispered, "and do not wake until the waters have borne you to safety."<br><br>Steel clashed against steel, much closer than before. She looked up with a gasp, then closed the lid of the little chest and pushed it out into the stream. "O Spirits of Brook and River," she called, "I beg you, protect my child! Carry her to safety far from these monstrous barbarians! Grant her some guise that will shield her from the cruelty of men!"<br><br>The little chest went bobbing away on the current as the woman watched, tears spilling down her cheeks, to dampen her robe.<br><br>Then a burst of shouting made her turn, gasping in terror. Three of the barbarians came galloping toward her on their small, hardy ponies, shouting in their uncouth language, sabers flashing in the moonlight.<br><br>"No!" she cried, and ran toward the gazebo--but one of the horsemen veered away from the others to come between herself and the slight safety of the screens. She stopped, uncertain, then turned to run to her left, but a horseman galloped wide to catch her by the arm. She screamed, but another horseman caught her other arm. She turned to bite his fingers, but the first struck the back of her head with his sword hilt, and she went limp.<br><br>Hauling her over the pommel of his saddle, he grinned at his fellow warriors. <br><br>"One more for the sacrifice," he said. "Angra Mainyu will be pleased!"<br><br>"I know not why that foreign sorcerer must give such an outlandish name to the Lord of Demo...</p><h2>Lord of the Rings Oracle Gift Set</h2><p>Officially licensed by Tolkien Enterprises, Inc.

Afflicted by poor health for most of his life, Alfred nevertheless showed unflagging energy as a warrior, administrator, scholar and educator. He was remarkable for both his range of interests and his wisdom. In battle he was faced by the Danish invaders and the real threat of Viking supremacy in England. With the help of the first Royal Navy, which he founded with minimal resources, the invaders were eventually repelled. Anglo-Saxon hegemony was preserved, for a while, and Alfred survived to found an English monarchy which, under his son and grandson, saw most of modern England united under one crown. The author examines the scale and intent of the relentless threat of conquest by the Viking sea-raiders, the military and logistical problems that beset both sides and the strategies devised by the king which led to the reconquest of his Wessex homeland and the creation of England itself.</p><p></p><h2>Threadwork Unraveled</h2><p>A compendium of everything you need to know about that most essential of quilting notions thread!

His account includes topics and characters largely ignored in other gold rush accounts. Bickham provides a detailed and intimate record of one man's experience enroute to, in and out of the mining camps.</p> <p>Bickham's account is now published for the first time in book form. His recounting of the voyage to San Francisco and his first months in the mines were described in letters sent to and originally printed in the Cincinnati Gazette. The second portion of his account is a journal, kept for his sisters in the east, of his experiences as a miner during the winter and spring of 1851 and as a customs inspector in San Francisco during the following summer and autumn of that year.</p> <p>Unique topics covered include friction between the Missouri "Jumpers" and the "Gentlemen Miners," the turmoil created by the Vigilantes, the San Francisco fire of June 22, 1851, the presence of Mormon families in the Northern Mines, and the lives and duties of San Francisco customs inspectors. An active member of the Whig party, Bickham records the electoral process in California from a local party meeting at Murderer's bar to the Statewide election of September 1851.</p> <p>Gold Rush frontier characters make regular appearances in Bickham's narrative, and epitomize his uncommon ability to bring to life events, places and people. His descriptions of jolly mountain man Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, Amazonian Mrs. Tubbs, hoydenish Sally Mayfield, saloon keeper/politician E. C. Cromwell, Sam Brannan and other frontier characters are vivid.</p> <p>Reflective musings allow a unique glimpse of the real Gold Rush experience: depression and stubborn optimism, longing for his family and keen interest in his surroundings. His is a vivid self-portrait by an intelligent and lively gold-seeker. Bickham was more articulate in his writings than most of his contemporaries, but shared the same moods, aspirations and experiences in a most dramatic era in frontier history.</p> <p>A handsome volume of 286 pages, containing an introduction, prologue, the journals, epilogue, notes, bibliography and index. Embellished with contemporary drawings, and two maps. Printed on acid-free paper and bound in linen cloth with foil stamped spine and front cover.</p></p><p><p><strong>Randall E.

But in every case, each police department had to deal with its share of good and bad cops, Pinkertons, gangsters, revolutionists, politicians, reporters, muckrakers, arsonists, murderers, district attorneys, strikers, labor spies, hanging judges, and axe-swinging crusaders, as well as every conceivable element of American society high and low.</p><p>But <i>American Police</i> also offers a view of the FBI and its legendary director, J.

This book is a companion to his erotic series, The Secret Paris of the 30s . A recreation of the 1933 edition, which did not appear here, it uses nearly all of Brassai's original plates and includes Paul Morand's original introductiona highly evocative travelogue narrative. The sensational, black-matted reproductions glow on the page, the effect heightened by the slight graininess characteristic of the process. Brassai's technique is so unobtrusive that we feel like unseen observers in the dark alleys, train yards, vegetable markets, and parks. Lighted by street lamps and devoid of crowds, it is a Paris few have seen. For photo-history collections.

Her marvelous talent for enchanting stories laced with sensuality is always a delight, and never more so than in this thirteenth-century tale of a brave knight who returns to the Welsh border to claim -- and tame -- his bride, or so he thinks.... After too many years on the battlefield, Merrick de Beaucourt is looking forward to a simple life of peace and quiet with a docile wife at his side. But when he finally fetches his bride-to-be from a secluded English convent, he finds he needs more than his knight&#39;s spurs to bring order to his life. When she was betrothed at fifteen to the legendary English knight she had never met, Lady Clio of Camrose believed that love was something magical. But her youthful hopes faded as she languished in a convent for six long years, never hearing a word from Merrick. Weary of war, Lord Merrick finds little peace guarding the wild Welsh borders, and even less with the wife whose trust he destroyed. But as Lady Clio comes to understand the dark knight she so blindly wed, she sees a chance to make her dreams come true. Amid the enchanted mists that envelop Camrose Castle, they will battle together to discover a place where all things are possible, even a love that is rare and wonderful.</p><p>Jill Barnett claims she got the idea for her 13th-century romance, <i>Wonderful,</i> from a beer commercial, from which she learned that ale-making was one of the few occupations open to medieval women. Lady Clio is a headstrong, independent-minded young woman who would like nothing more than to rediscover the long-lost recipe for "heather ale," which was created by the Picts. Although lovely, Clio has long given up on marriage because her betrothed abandoned her to a convent six years before. When Merrick de Beaucort suddenly arrives to claim his bride, he finds that wooing the beautiful Lady Clio is as difficult and arduous as any battle he has faced. Beneath Clio's placid countenance and seemingly docile demeanor lies a lively and adventurous woman with a lot of ideas that Merrick must accept if he is ever to win her love.<p> <b>From "Wonderful"</b> </p><p> <i>Camrose Castle,</i><br> <i>1269</i> </p><p> Lady Clio's father claimed her pale silvery hair was her greatest asset...or perhaps his greatest asset, considering he had the duty to see her wed to some poor unsuspecting fool. </p><p> To look at Lady Clio of Camrose, one would think she was the image of what every man, knight or king, peasant or merchant, wanted in a wife -- someone who was meek in spirit: to make a man feel braver and stronger. A wife who was docile enough to allow a man to be the king of his castle. A woman whose head was as light inside as outside, to assure him that he would be more intelligent and therefore superior. </p><p> According to the Church, the color of a woman's hair bespoke her true nature. The men empowered by the Church based this theory on the conclusion that hair grew directly from the brain. </p><p> Fiery hair in a woman warned men of a woman's devilish spirit. Since woodland covered two thirds of the English isle, hair the color of tree trunks was considered common and showed the woman had little imagination. </p><p> Hair the color of midnight, which everyone knew was the witching hour, crowned the heads of women all too clever and devious. 'Twas even said by those same men of the Church that Eve herself had hair as black as a woman's sin. </p><p> But a woman with light hair was perfect. </p><p> Unfortunately, those men of the Church did not know Clio. Like a field of golden buttercups that hides a prickly hedgehog, Lady Clio's hair hid her true nature. </p><p> She was headstrong and determined, traits admired in men but scoffed at in women. Her father swore she had been born with that stubbornness. </p><p> Before Clio's birth, Clio's mother had lost five babes. With Clio, as before, her mother's birthing pains had come before her time. So Clio came into the world two months early. When the priest tried to perform Last Rites over her puny blue body, she kicked his hand and, according to her father, opened her mouth and almost wailed the castle walls down. </p><p> To the utter amazement of everyone, Clio lived. </p><p> From the first moment of her life she had fought against the impossible. Lady Clio was born fighting to control her own destiny. </p><p> Of course, in her mind she wasn't stubborn. Persistent was what she was. Had she given up at birth where would she be? </p><p> Dead, that's where. </p><p> So Clio believed in being determined. She would not let anyone control her life, for only she held power over her survival. </p><p> She believed that with persistence came success. If one of her wonderful plans failed, she could always come up with another. </p><p> She was small in stature, but had the heart of a giant. Her mind was sometimes too quick for her own good. Once she got one of her infamous ideas into her head, she seldom thought about the consequences, of which there were usually many. </p><p> Yet no one could say she did not learn from her errors. </p><p> She was not that much of a goose. She seldom made the same mistake twice. </p><p> She always made new mistakes. </p><p> Which suited her, because she was the one who determined her own future. Even if the path was strewn with the remnants of her failures. At least they were <i>her</i> failures. </p><p> Clio never allowed something as minor as a lack of skill to daunt her efforts. She firmly believed perfection came with practice. Of course she had no sound reason on which to base this belief. Indeed, history, logic, and her reputation demanded just the opposite. </p><p> But she loved a challenge. Embraced it, reveled in it. Those who knew her called her tenacious spirit a mulish exercise in futility. But Clio just didn't believe in giving up. She would just conjure up a new plan -- an idea. </p><p> Clio thought ideas were a wonderful things. Those who had been privy to some of her fiascoes recognized the warning signs. The quiet and sudden stillness of her manner. The small frown line that wrinkled between her brows. The thoughtful chewing of her lower lip or the twisting of her mother's jeweled ring on her finger. Her expression became dovelike. Peaceful. </p><p> But whenever Lady Clio got that look and, worse yet, when she claimed aloud that she had one of her "wonderful ideas," those around her immediately lost their sense of peace. </p><p> With good reason. </p><p> When she had just passed her tenth saint's day, her father paid a large penance to the Gregorian monks for what he referred to as "chanting for help." Months later he'd claimed it was worth eating all those nightly platters of cheap, stringy mutton, since it only took until St. Thomas the Martyr's Day to haul the new catapult out of the moat. </p><p> When the tinker's cart had suffered the same fate two years before, it had taken twice as long to recover and had cost him much more. </p><p> At age twelve Clio took up a needle and thread to tend a hunting wound of a visiting bishop. After which her father used all the gold in his heavy purse to buy pardons for her from a passing pilgrim. </p><p> It seemed that unbeknownst to her father, the lecherous bishop had chased Clio for the entire previous week and had foolishly cornered her on the staircase, where he stole a kiss and squeezed her small breasts. So when it came time to doctor him, she had smiled sweetly and stitched up his wound in the shape of three sixes, the sign of the devil. </p><p> At fifteen, Clio was banished from the queen's court after only two disastrous days, and her father sent the pope a jewel-encrusted golden chalice in the hope of receiving papal prayer on behalf of his daughter and only child. </p><p> It had worked, for a week later the betrothal offer arrived from Merrick de Beaucourt, a knight who was then in the Holy Lands making the English king and the Church wealthier under the guise of fighting the infidels. </p><p> She asked her father to tell her what Sir Merrick was like. Her father said he was a great warrior. </p><p> That was not exactly the answer Clio was looking for. </p><p> She wanted to know if he was tall and kind and had a face that was sweet on the eyes. If he could play the lute and sing love poems. If he would hand her his heart on a silver platter. </p><p> Her father laughed and claimed Sir Merrick would protect her and that it did not matter whether she liked him or not, because she had no choice. The betrothal was by order of King Henry, his liege lord. </p><p> But de Beaucourt was to be gone for four more years and her father caught a chill one exceptionally cold winter day and died a few days later. </p><p> Lady Clio became a ward of Henry III. Queen Eleanor still barred her from court -- once had been quite enough, thank you -- and suggested that the king pawn his new ward off on one of their enemies, perhaps whoever was the latest troublesome Welsh prince. </p><p> Henry refused. He wasn't ready to start a war. </p><p> So until de Beaucourt returned from the Crusade, the king sent Lady Clio to a remote convent, where her life continued much as it had before her father's death: one "wonderful idea" after another. </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 1997 by Jill Barnett Stadler</p></p><h2>Welcome to the Monkeyhouse and Palm Sunday</h2><p>Kurt Vonnegut, described by Graham Greene as &#34;One of the best living American writers&#34;, is equally well known as an essayist and commentator on American society as he is a novelist.

Gay liberation&#x2019;s founders were Communists, and its activist core is still overwhelmingly progressive. But in recent years, a more affluent group of gay men has begun to make its mark. Though they are a minority in the queer community (which includes people of all races, classes and genders), conservatives have become the loudest gay voices in the mainstream media. With their withering contempt for feminism and radical politics, these &#x2018;gayocons&#x2019; are changing the movement&#x2019;s public image. Unless their rise is met by a persuasive critique, they may also alter its heart and soul.<br><br><i>Homocons</i> offers such a critique. It describes how the gay Right agenda differs from the one the queer community has long embraced. Never abandoning its analysis of the complex relationship between homosexuals and liberal society, the book examines the conflict between liberationists and assimilationists that has raged since the Stonewall era, and explores how political success tipped the balance and facilitated the rise of the gay Right. Finally this book offers an alternative to gay conservatism grounded in queer humanism, a distinct sensibility that has been a major force in progressive thought for more than a century.</p><p><b>Richard Goldstein</b> is an executive editor of <i>The Village Voice</i> and the author of several books including <i>The Poetry of Rock</i>, <i>Goldstein&#x2019;s Greatest Hits</i>, and <i>Reporting the Counterculture</i>.

Polls show that public opinion regarding the government has plummeted to all-time lows, with only one in five saying they trust the government or believe that it operates in their interest. Yet, at the same time, more Americans than ever benefit from some form of government social provision. Political scientist Suzanne Mettler calls this growing gulf between people&#x2019;s perceptions of government and the actual role it plays in their lives the "government-citizen disconnect." In <i>The Government-Citizen Disconnect</i>, she explores the rise of this phenomenon and its implications for policymaking and politics.<br> <br> Drawing from original survey data which probed Americans&#x2019; experiences of 21 federal social policies -- such as food stamps, Social Security, Medicaid, and the home mortgage interest deduction -- Mettler shows that 96 percent of adults have received benefits from at least one of them, and that the average person has utilized five. Overall usage rates transcend social, economic, and political divisions, and most Americans report positive experiences of their policy experiences. However, the fact that they have benefited from these policies has little positive effect on people&#x2019;s attitudes toward government. Mettler finds that shared identities and group affiliations, as well as ideological forces, are more powerful and consistent influences. In particular, those who oppose welfare tend to extrapolate their unfavorable views of it to government in general. Deep antipathy toward the government has emerged as the result of a conservative movement that has waged a war on social welfare policies for over forty years, even as economic inequality and benefit use have increased. <br> <br> Mettler finds that voting patterns exacerbate the government-citizen disconnect, as those holding positive views of federal programs and supporting expanded benefits have lower rates of political participation than those holding more hostile views of the government. As a result, the loudest political voice belongs to those who have benefited from policies but who give government little credit for their economic well-being, seeing their success more as a matter of their own deservingness. This contributes to the election of politicians who advocate cutting federal social programs. According to Mettler, the government-citizen disconnect frays the bonds of representative government and democracy.<br> <br> <i>The Government-Citizen Disconnect</i> illuminates a paradox that increasingly shapes American politics. Mettler's examination of hostility toward government at a time when most Americans will at some point rely on the social benefits it provides helps us better understand the roots of today's fractious political climate.<br> <br> </p></p><p><p>"Why do so many Americans both depend on public programs and express distrust and opposition to the federal government that provides them? Suzanne Mettler, one of the most original political scientists working today, offers crucial answers to this puzzle. Her important new book, <i>The Government-Citizen Disconnect</i>, will engage citizens and scholars alike at a juncture of crisis, controversy, and revitalization for American democracy."</p><p><b>&#x2014;Theda Skocpol,</b> director, Scholars Strategy Network, and Victor S.

For two jaded middle-aged couples, coming face-to-face with what might have been proves to be a shattering experience. The genius script by Sondheim and Goldman makes a cinematic, nightmarish hallucination of past and present blended together, employing lush era musical theatre pastiche and a deft eye for storytelling to tell not only the story of Ben, Phyllis, Sally and Buddy, but also the story of how the promise of America between the World Wars disintegrated into memory. Considered by many to be one of the best American musicals of all time, and still at the peak of form and craft.

In <i>More Than Freedom</i>, award-winning historian Stephen Kantrowitz boldly redefines our understanding of this entire era by showing that the fight to abolish slavery was always part of a much broader campaign to establish full citizenship for African Americans and find a place to belong in a white republic.<br><i>More Than Freedom</i> chronicles this epic struggle through the lived experiences of black and white activists in and around Boston, including both famous reformers such as Frederick Douglass and Charles Sumner and lesser-known but equally important figures like the journalist William Cooper Nell and the ex-slaves Lewis and Harriet Hayden. While these freedom fighters have traditionally been called abolitionists, their goals and achievements went far beyond emancipation. They mobilized long before they had white allies to rely on and remained militant long after the Civil War ended.<br>These black freedmen called themselves "colored citizens" and fought to establish themselves in American public life, both by building their own networks and institutions and by fiercely, often violently, challenging proslavery and inegalitarian laws and prejudice. But as Kantrowitz explains, they also knew that until the white majority recognized them as equal participants in common projects they would remain a suspect class. Equal citizenship meant something far beyond freedom: not only full legal and political rights, but also acceptance, inclusion and respect across the color line.<br>Even though these reformers ultimately failed to remake the nation in the way they hoped, their struggle catalyzed the arrival of Civil War and left the social and political landscape of the Union forever altered. Without their efforts, war and Reconstruction could hardly have begun. Bringing a bold new perspective to one of our nation's defining moments, <i>More Than Freedom</i> helps to explain the extent and the limits of the so-called freedom achieved in 1865 and the legacy that endures today.</p><p><b>Stephen Kantrowitz </b>is a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he has earned several teaching prizes.

But I could see nothing but the lacing on the bodice of the lady standing in front of me, blocking my view of the scaffold. I had been at this court for more than a year and attended hundreds of festivities; but never before one like this.</p><p>By stepping to one side a little and craning my neck, I could see the condemned man, accompanied by his priest, walk slowly from the Tower toward the green where the wooden platform was waiting, the block of wood placed center stage, the executioner dressed all ready for work in his shirtsleeves with a black hood over his head. It looked more like a masque than a real event, and I watched it as if it were a court entertainment. The king, seated on his throne, looked distracted, as if he was running through his speech of forgiveness in his head. Behind him stood my husband of one year, William Carey, my brother, George, and my father, Sir Thomas Boleyn, all looking grave. I wriggled my toes inside my silk slippers and wished the king would hurry up and grant clemency so that we could all go to breakfast. I was only thirteen years old, I was always hungry.</p><p>The Duke of Buckinghamshire, far away on the scaffold, put off his thick coat. He was close enough kin for me to call him uncle. He had come to my wedding and given me a gilt bracelet. My father told me that he had offended the king a dozen ways: he had royal blood in his veins and he kept too large a retinue of armed men for the comfort of a king not yet wholly secure on his throne; worst of all he was supposed to have said that the king had no son and heir now, could get no son and heir, and that he would likely die without a son to succeed him to the throne.</p><p>Such a thought must not be said out loud. The king, the court, the whole country knew that a boy must be born to the queen, and born soon. To suggest otherwise was to take the first step on the path that led to the wooden steps of the scaffold which the duke, my uncle, now climbed, firmly and without fear. A good courtier never refers to any unpalatable truths. The life of a court should always be merry.</p><p>Uncle Stafford came to the front of the stage to say his final words. I was too far from him to hear, and in any case I was watching the king, waiting for his cue to step forward and offer the royal pardon. This man standing on the scaffold, in the sunlight of the early morning, had been the king's partner at tennis, his rival on the jousting field, his friend at a hundred bouts of drinking and gambling, they had been comrades since the king was a boy. The king was teaching him a lesson, a powerful public lesson, and then he would forgive him and we could all go to breakfast.</p><p>The little faraway figure turned to his confessor. He bowed his head for a blessing and kissed the rosary. He knelt before the block and clasped it in both hands. I wondered what it must </p><p>be like, to put one's cheek to the smooth waxed wood, to smell the warm wind coming off the river, to hear, overhead, the cry of seagulls. Even knowing as he did that this was a masque and not the real thing, it must be odd for Uncle to put his head down and know that the executioner was standing behind.</p><p>The executioner raised his ax. I looked toward the king. He was leaving his intervention very late. I glanced back at the stage. My uncle, head down, flung wide his arms, a sign of his consent, the signal that the ax could fall. I looked back to the king, he must rise to his feet now. But he still sat, his handsome face grim. And while I was still looking toward him there was another roll of drums, suddenly silenced, and then the thud of the ax, first once, then again and a third time: a sound as domestic as chopping wood. Disbelievingly, I saw the head of my uncle bounce into the straw and a scarlet gush of blood from the strangely stumpy neck. The black-hooded axman put the great stained ax to one side and lifted the head by the thick curly hair, so that we could all see the strange mask-like thing: black with the blindfold from forehead to nose, and the teeth bared in a last defiant grin.</p><p>The king rose slowly from his seat and I thought, childishly, "Dear God, how awfully embarrassing this is going to be. He has left it too late. It has all gone wrong. He forgot to speak in time."</p><p>But I was wrong. He did not leave it too late, he did not forget. He wanted my uncle to die before the court so that everybody might know that there was only one king, and that was Henry. There could be only one king, and that was Henry. And there would be a son born to this king -- and even to suggest otherwise meant a shameful death.</p><p>The court returned quietly to Westminster Palace in three barges, rowed up the river. The men on the riverbank pulled off their hats and kneeled as the royal barge went swiftly past with a flurry of pennants and a glimpse of rich cloth. I was in the second barge with the ladies of the court, the queen's barge. My mother was seated near me. In a rare moment of interest she glanced at me and remarked, "You're very pale, Mary, are you feeling sick?"</p><p>"I didn't think he would be executed," I said. "I thought the king would forgive him."</p><p>My mother leaned forward so that her mouth was at my ear and no one could have heard us over the creaking of the boat and the beat of the rowers' drum. "Then you are a fool," she said shortly. "And a fool to remark it. Watch and learn, Mary. There is no room for mistakes at court."</p><p>Copyright � 2001 by Philippa Gregory Ltd.</p></p><h2>Spirit Junkie: A Radical Road to Self-Love and Miracles</h2><p><p>How does a New York City publicist and party girl turn into a go to guide for the next generation?

What happens between the farm and the kitchen? Why are all avocados from Mexico? Why does a restaurant in Maine order lamb from New Zealand? In <i>Food Routes</i>, Robyn Metcalfe explores an often-overlooked aspect of the global food system: how food moves from producer to consumer. She finds that the food supply chain is adapting to our increasingly complex demands for both personalization and convenience&#x2015;but, she says, it won't be an easy ride. </p><p>Networked, digital tools will improve the food system but will also challenge our relationship to food in anxiety-provoking ways. It might not be easy to transfer our affections from verdant fields of organic tomatoes to high-rise greenhouses tended by robots. And yet, argues Metcalfe&#x2015;a cautious technology optimist&#x2015;technological advances offer opportunities for innovations that can get better food to more people in an increasingly urbanized world. </p><p>Metcalfe follows a slice of New York pizza and a club sandwich through the food supply chain; considers local foods, global foods, and food deserts; investigates the processing, packaging, and storage of food; explores the transportation networks that connect farm to plate; and explains how food can be tracked using sensors and the Internet of Things. Future food may be engineered, networked, and nearly independent of crops grown in fields. New technologies can make the food system more efficient&#x2015;but at what cost to our traditionally close relationship with food?</p></p><p>Robyn Metcalfe, a food historian and food futurist, is a Lecturer and Research Scholar at the University of Texas at Austin and Director of Food+City.<p>Many books have been written about food's ability to transform and transport in a metaphorical sense. Food historian and futurist Robyn Metcalfe tells a different kind of story. She focuses on the literal transformation and transportation of food and how that affects our lives. In her new book, Metcalfe takes a detailed look at behind-the-scenes issues of the food supply chain: how food is grown, processed, transported, and consumed. Metcalfe examines how these processes are being changed by technology and their impact on how we eat today and in the future</p>&#x2015;<i>the Boston Globe</i><br><br><p>This is a book about a hidden side of food, not exactly how it is produced, far less consumed, but about how it is managed &#x201c;between farm and plate&#x201d;.

It&#39;s irreverent. But, more than anything, FoxTrot is reliably funny year after year, strip after strip. FoxTrot Collection is the latest collection of strips featuring the funny and flawed Fox family. It marks the 23rd collection of this comic strip staple that can be found in more than 1,000 newspapers worldwide every day. FoxTrot Collection is the latest chronicle of the chaotic Fox family-parents Roger and Andy, teenagers Peter and Paige, and ten-year old Jason and his pet iguana, Quincy. This book finds Roger behind his keyboard struggling to write a spy novel, prompting helpful writing advice from Jason such as &#34;the &#39;on&#39; switch is that little round one.&#34; The others add to the insanity, with Jason battling video games, Paige searching for a personal assistant, Peter eating and eating, and Andy stressing through it all.Everyone experiences day-to-day turmoil in their family life, which is why Bill Amend&#39;s FoxTrot Collection is sure to resonate with readers across the globe.</p><p>Bill Amend&#39;s FoxTrot debuted April 10, 1988, and is among the most popular strips of the last quarter century. His strip appears in 1,000 papers and there are more than 1.75 million of his cartoon collections in circulation.Adult/High School-This collection lives up to the appeal of its 16 predecessors. Hyperintelligent and annoying Jason seems to be growing up, but he's still capable of tormenting his older siblings, Paige and Peter, as they go through the trials of high school exams. Amend is consistently funny and occasionally insightful, and the three youngsters, as well as their parents, Roger and Andy, cover the spectrum of family dynamics. A series of comics featuring excerpts from their father's painful attempts at writing a spy novel is particularly amusing. Amend's drawings are clean and consistent, and both the artistic style and the mischievous source of humor evoke memories of Bill Watterson's "Calvin and Hobbes" titles.<br><i>Paul Brink, Fairfax County Public Library System, VA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Finding God in the Questions: A Personal Journey</h2><p>One of Massachusetts Bible Society's Top Ten Religious Books of 2004! #8 on the <em>New York Times</em> Hardcover Advice Bestseller List! (June 14, 2004) #7 on the <em>Publishers Weekly</em> Religion Hardcover Bestseller List (October 2004) Do you wonder whether or not God is real? Do you doubt that religion can be relevant? Do you wish that faith were possible for you? Don't shy away from your questions, says Dr. Timothy Johnson, medical editor for ABC News. He believes that's where God meets you--in the midst of honest grappling with heartfelt issues. In this remarkable book, Dr. Johnson discloses his deeply personal journey of faith. With the same keen mind accustomed to medical and scientific examination, he investigates the plausibility of God's existence and explores the significance of the person of Jesus. Despite all the difficulties of faith, he explains what he believes and why. He writes, "As a physician, I have committed my professional life to healing and wellness. But my public work is only a small part of who I really am--or rather, who I want to be. This book is, in a sense, 'the rest of the story.' "For many people, religion provides answers to the big questions of life. For others, the absolute claims of religion raise more questions than they answer. I have lived on both sides--and in some senses, I still do. My path of faith has wandered through both doubt and belief, often at the same time. "Doubt doesn't have to tear down belief, however; it can purify it. When it does, the beliefs on the other side become more certain. This is why I would like to affirm that it is possible to find God even while you are still asking the big questions." Come join a fellow pilgrim on the journey. Ask your questions--and perhaps find God behind them.</p><p>"To all of his colleagues here at ABC News, Timothy Johnson has always been a generous dispenser of medical advice and balm to the soul. To accompany him now on these chapters of his own spiritual journey is to find confirmation of the possibility that great accomplishment and humility can coexist." Ted Koppel, Anchor and Managing Editor, ABC News Nightline <p>"Dr. Tim Johnson, minister and physician, brilliantly analyzes his struggle with religious belief when juxtaposed to emerging scientific discoveries. The result is a deep humanitarian exposition of the significance of the teaching of Jesus, which provides a firm foundation for addressing life's challenges." Dr. Joseph Martin, Dean, Harvard Medical School </p><p>"Tim Johnson has excelled in two of the most skeptical arenas of American life--media and medicine--while holding on to a strong and intelligent faith. Now America's best-known TV news doctor shares his own questions and his decades-long journey making sense out of the faith that shapes his life." Peggy Wehmeyer, host and managing editor, World Vision Report, and former religion correspondent, ABC News </p><p>"Dr. Johnson treats the soul as a wise physician treats the body, with honesty, tenderness and compassion. His introspective look at his own spiritual journey helped illuminate my own." Philip Yancey, author of Rumors of Another World and What's So Amazing About Grace? </p><p>"Dr. Timothy Johnson takes the reader on an exciting and highly informative spiritual journey. He casts a medically trained and critical eye on the evidence for answers to questions that haunt every human being--questions concerning our identity, our purpose in life and our destiny. Both the believer and the unbeliever will find this excellent book so challenging and so absorbing they will find it difficult to put down."

The apostle James faced these questions in profound ways and offered sound pastoral advice to his readers, scattered by persecution. His word to them can become a vital word to us if we are prepared to listen. In this keen, pastorally oriented commentary, readers will find helpful background marterial concerning authorship, date and purpose, as well as helpful, passage-by-passage commentary. The exposition focuses on understanding what James had to say to his original readers in order to see its relevance for the church today. Students, pastors, Bible teachers and everyone who wants to understand the message of James for the church will benefit from this excellent resource.</p><p>Stulac (D.Min., Covenant Theological Seminary) is pastor of Memorial Presbyterian Church in St. Louis.</p><h2>Our Musseque (Dedalus Africa)</h2><p>Our Musseque is a tale of growing up in one of the vibrant shanty towns (musseques) of Luanda during the 1940s and 1950s. Weaving back and forwards through his half-remembered childhood, the narrator draws us into a close-knit world of labourers, shopkeepers, drunks, prostitutes and determined women battling to bring up their families, as Angola hurtles towards the beginning of its armed struggle against Portuguese colonial rule. Meanwhile the children laugh, play, squabble and fight, puzzle at racial taunts and move rapidly through adolescence towards sexual awakening and a greater awareness of political realities around them. Written in prison in 1961-62 but not published until over 40 years later, the novel is shot through with a sense of nostalgia for the lost innocence of childhood and a community swept away by the encroaching city, together with the exhilaration, hopes and fears for what is about to come.</p><p>José Luandino Vieira was born in Portugal in 1935 and grew up in Luanda. He was one of a group of political activists whose trial in 1959 helped spark the Angolan uprising against colonial rule. He spent most of the following fifteen years in prison or under house arrest, until the collapse of the Portuguese dictatorship in 1974.

The organizers of the session, which ran from December 19 to 26, 1936, had never planned it to be some kind of extra-judicial venue to try genetics. Nicolai Ivanovich Muralov, the new head of the Lenin Academy, tried to maintain an even-handed debate. Muralov&#x2019;s reputation was one of warmth and fairness&#x2015;but he was in serious trouble.

Born in the Seneca Hotel on Chicago&#x2019;s Near North Side, he relocated in his adolescence to New Orleans. The move proved significant: throughout his career, Gifford&#x2019;s fiction&#x2014;part-noir, part-picaresque, always entertaining&#x2014;is born of the clash between what he has referred to as his &#x201c;Northern Side&#x201d; and &#x201c;Southern Side.&#x201d; Gifford has been recipient of awards from PEN, the National Endowment for the Arts, the American Library Association, the Writers Guild of America and the Christopher Isherwood Foundation.

She is originally from Philadelphia and holds a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Pennsylvania.</p>Gossip figures prominently in three of the four Regency-era novellas included in this collection, which is, unfortunately, as shallow as a Hollywood rumor rag. James incorporates the theme she used most successfully in "A Proper Englishwoman," employing a number of gossipy letters as a prelude to a bold, if unlikely, tale of seduction. Far less inventive are London's "The Vicar's Widow" and Navin's "Miss Jenny Alt's First Kiss." The former is a predictable tale of two lovers and the jealous debutante who will do anything, even spread nasty rumors about a virtuous widow, to pull them apart, and the latter is an equally familiar romance between a bookish beauty with an undeserved reputation and a handsome lord. Lee's "Clearly a Couple" stands out both for its exemplary writing and its unique heroine, though the story has very little to do with gossip. Its premise is also far too meaty for such a short story, so it inevitably falls prey to the same flaw as the others&#x2014;the protagonists' love comes too swiftly and unbelievably. All in all, this lackluster collection is a pale representation of these authors' works and isn't likely to stir up much chatter in the romance community. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With eloquence and wit, Stuart traces his twenty-year career in education, which began, when he was only seventeen years old, with teaching grades one through eight in a one-room schoolhouse. Before long Stuart was on a path that made him principal and finally superintendent of city and county schools. The road was not smooth, however, and Stuart faced many challenges, from students who were considerably older -- and bigger -- than he to well-meaning but distrustful parents, uncooperative administrators and, most daunting, his own fear of failure. Through it all, Stuart never lost his abiding faith in the power of education. A graceful ode to what he considered the greatest profession there is, Jesse Stuart&#39;s &#34;The Thread That Runs So True&#34; is timeless proof that &#34;good teaching is forever and the teacher is immortal.&#34;</p><p><b>Jesse Stuart</b> worked his way through Lincoln Memorial and Vanderbilt Universities, and taught school in his native Kentucky. He lectured at various colleges and universities until 1954, when he suffered a near-fatal heart attack. After his recovery, he returned to writing, lecturing, and farming. As a specialist for the U.S. Department of State, he traveled around the world, and he served as a visiting lecturer and professor at the American University in Cairo in 1960-61. His work includes nearly thirty books, ranging from poetry to biography, autobiography, novels, and short stories. Jesse Stuart died in 1984.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>Monday morning when I started on my way to school, I had with me Don Conway, a pupil twenty years of age, who had never planned to enter school again. I was the new teacher here at Lonesome Valley and I didn't know what kind of brains he had. He had left school when he was in the fourth grade. But I did know that he had two good fists and that he would be on my side. All day Sunday while I had worked at the schoolhouse, I was trying to think of a plan so I could stay at Lonesome Valley School. I knew I had to stay. I knew if one had to go it would be Guy Hawkins. I might have to use my head a little but that was why I had it.<br><br>It had taken a lot of persuasion to get Don Conway to return to school. He had planned to get married after his tobacco crop was sold. But I explained the value of an education to him in dollars and cents. I told him I would teach him how to measure a field and figure the number of acres, how to figure the number of bushels in a wagon bed, cornbin, and how many cubic yards of dirt one would have to remove to dig a cellar or a well. Don Conway was interested in this type of knowledge. I told him no man should be married and live on a farm unless he knew these simple things, for he could easily be cheated the rest of his days. I was interested in his learning these things all right, but I was interested in something else.<br><br>Don, his two small brothers, his sister Vaida, and I went to school together. I congratulated John Conway for sending all his children but one. I told him he should set the example for other farmers on the creek. It would have been hard on John to try to worm and sucker his ten acres of tobacco and care for his other crops if Flossie, his older daughter, had not volunteered to help him. And Bertha, his wife, assured him she would divide her time between the housework and work in the field.<br><br>Flossie, eighteen years old, who had left school six years ago, would gladly have started back to school if I had insisted. But I knew John and Bertha had to have someone left to help them. I insisted and almost begged Don to return to school when he and I were sitting on the porch late one Sunday afternoon and Ova Salyers and Guy Hawkins rode past on their horses. They glanced toward the porch for their first look at the new teacher, never spoke but rode silently down the road.<br><br>Don Conway looked at Guy Hawkins and Ova Salyers and then he looked at me. He didn't ask me how old I was. I didn't tell him in eighteen more days I would be seventeen. One had to be eighteen before he was old enough to teach school. Don Conway knew the fate of my sister when she was employed to teach the Lonesome Valley School. He knew how Guy Hawkins had blacked her eyes with his fists, had whipped her before the Lonesome Valley pupils. She was a fair-haired, beautiful blue-eyed girl of nineteen when she had come to Lonesome Valley. She went home a nervous wreck, long before her school was finished. After I'd seen the way my sister was beaten up, I begged to go to Lonesome Valley. My parents would have none of it. They thought if I went hunting trouble I would get more than my share.<br><br>But I made the mistake at Landsburgh High School of going to the wrong room. I'd forgotten the Greenwood County rural teachers were having "teacher's examination" in our American literature room. And when Superintendent Harley Staggers, who didn't know all his teachers, mistook me for a rural teacher an idea came to me. I knew the school I wanted if I passed the examination. I made a second-class certificate. Then I had John Hampton, a rural teacher and friend, contact John Conway and get the school for me. Superintendent Staggers didn't want me to go to Lonesome Valley. But there wasn't anything he could do about it after John Conway, Lonesome Valley District School trustee, recommended me. That was why I was here to teach school.<br><br>When Don and I reached the schoolhouse, at least thirty-five pupils were there waiting outside. Guy Hawkins and Ova Salyers were standing together near the coalhouse with their torn-and-tattered, first-grade books. They looked out of place with the other pupils. They were larger than either Don or me. They were older too. They looked at me when I said "Good morning" to them. Many of the pupils turned shyly away and did not speak. They were waiting for the schoolhouse to be unlocked so they could rush in and select their seats. Each had his dinner basket or bucket in his hand. The majority of them carried tattered-edged and backless books.<br><br>I thought we had reached the schoolhouse very early. It wasn't eight o'clock and school didn't start until eight-thirty. The July sun hadn't dried the dew from parts of the valley yet; dew was ascending in white formless clouds from the tobacco, cane, and corn patches. But the people in Lonesome Valley went to bed early and got up early. All of the pupils in Lonesome Valley came from farms.<br><br>The girls wore pigtails down their backs tied with all colors of ribbons. They wore clean print dresses and they were barefooted. Not one pupil in my school, large or small, boy or girl, wore a pair of shoes. I'd never seen in my life so many barefooted people, young, middle-aged, and old, as I had seen in Lonesome Valley. Wearing gloves on their hands in summer was the same to them as wearing shoes on their feet. They just didn't do it.<br><br>"Well, I'm opening the door," I said, to break the silence of my pupils.<br><br>When I opened the door they laughed, screamed, and raced for the schoolhouse. Their shyness was gone now. There was a mad scramble to get inside the schoolhouse for seats. Then there was some discussion among them as to who would sit by whom. Girls had selected their seatmates. There were a few controversies and a few hurt feelings. Often two pupils wanted to sit by the same person. No trouble with Guy and Ova. They walked inside reluctantly and sat down in a seat on the boys' side farthest from my desk.<br><br>"Now let me make an announcement to you before school starts," I said, after walking up to my desk. "There will not any longer be a girls' side and a boys' side. Sit anyplace you want to."<br><br>They looked strangely at one another. Not one boy would cross to the girls' side. Not one girl would cross to the boys' side. In Lonesome Valley it was hard to break a teaching tradition more than a century old. But after I had been to high school, where there were no such things as a girls' side and a boys' side in a schoolroom, I didn't see why it wouldn't work in Lonesome Valley. Little did I dream that what I had said here would make news in Lonesome Valley, that it would be talked about by everybody, and that many would criticize me and call my school "a courting school." Boys and girls sitting together? Who had ever heard tell of it?<br><br>The schedules were not made out for the teachers at the Superintendent's office. No one had ever heard of such routine. Each teacher had to make his own schedule. And that was what I had done long before I left home for Lonesome Valley. I knew what I had to teach and I went to work, making out my schedule and dividing my time as accurately as possible for my six hours of actual work. I had to conduct fifty-four classes in this time, for I had pupils from the chart class to and including the eighth grade.<br><br>When I walked down the broad center aisle and pulled on the bell rope, the soft tones sounded over the tobacco, corn, and cane fields and the lush green valley; with the ringing of this bell, my school had begun. I knew that not half the pupils in the school census were here. There were 104 in the school census, of school age, for whom the state sent per capita money to pay for their schooling. I had thirty.five pupils. I thought the soft tones of this school bell through the rising mists and over warm cultivated fields where parents and their children were trying to eke out a bare subsistence from the soil might bring back warm memories of happy school days. For I remembered the tones of the Plum Grove school bell, and how I had longed to be back in school after I had quit at the age of nine to work for twenty-five cents a day to help support my family. If I could have, I would have returned to school when I heard the Plum Grove bell. So I rang the bell and called the Lonesome Valley pupils back to school -- back to books and play. For going to school had never been work to me. It had been recreation. And I hoped it would be the same for my pupils in Lonesome Valley.<br><br>During my first day all I did was enroll my pupils in their classes, call them up front to the recitation seat and give them assignments in the few textbooks they possessed. At that time, the textbooks were not furnished by the state. Each pupil had to furnish his own. If he didn't, there was a meager allotment of cash set aside by the Greenwood County School Board of Education to buy books for those whose parents were not able to buy them. I knew that many would buy books after the tobacco crops had been sold or the cane had been made into sorghum and sold. These were the money crops in Lonesome Valley.<br><br>While enrolling my pupils, I made some temporary changes in seating arrangements. I often put a pupil without books beside a pupil with books, if they were in the same grade. As I enrolled the pupils, I tried to remember and familiarize myself with each name. I tried to get acquainted with my pupils. I found them very shy. I was a stranger among them, though I had grown up under similar circumstances with equivalent opportunities. There were approximately thirty miles separating their Lonesome Valley from my W-Hollow. But I was a stranger here.<br><br>When I dismissed my pupils for the first recess, a fifteen-minute period between the beginning of the school day and the noon hour, I was amazed to see them all jump up from their seats at the same time and try to be the first out of the house. Big pupils pushed past the little ones and there was so much confusion and disorder, I knew they would never leave the room like this again. Why were they running? I wondered. I had a few minutes' work to do before I could join them on the playground. Before I had finished this work, I heard the tenor of their uneven voices singing these familiar words:<br><br>The needle's eye that does supply,<br><br>The thread that runs so true,<br><br>Many a beau, have I let go,<br><br>Because I wanted you.<br><br>Many a dark and stormy night,<br><br>When I went home with you,<br><br>I stumped my toe and down I go,<br><br>Because I wanted you.<br><br>I walked to the door and watched them. They had formed a circle, hand in hand, and around and around they walked and sang these words while two pupils held their locked hands high for the circle to pass under. Suddenly the two standing -- one inside the circle and one outside -- let their arms drop down to take a pupil from the line. Then the circle continued to march and sing while the two took the pupil aside and asked him whether he would rather be a train or an automobile. If the pupil said he'd rather be an automobile, he stood on one side; if a train, he stood on the other of the two that held hands. And when they had finished taking everybody from the circle, the two groups faced each other, lined up behind their captains. Each put his arms around the pupil in front of him and locked his hands. The first line to break apart or to be pulled forward lost the game.<br><br>Fifteen minutes were all too short for them to play "the needle's eye." I let recess extend five minutes so they could finish their second game. It had been a long time since I had played this game at Plum Grove. These words brought back pleasant memories. They fascinated me. And my Lonesome Valley pupils played this game with all the enthusiasm and spirit they had! They put themselves into it -- every pupil in school. Not one stood by to watch. Because they were having the time of their lives, I hated to ring the bell for "books." I lined them up, smaller pupils in front and larger ones behind, and had them march back into the schoolroom.<br><br>Guy Hawkins and Ova Salyers were the last on the line. When they came inside the door, Guy asked permission to go with Ova after a bucket of water. We didn't have a well or a cistern at the schoolhouse. We had to get water from some home in the district. I told them they could go but not to be gone too long, for the pupils, after running and playing, were thirsty. The July sun beat down on the galvanized tin roof. This made the pine boards so hot inside they oozed resin. We raised all the windows but still the place was hot as the room in which I slept at Conways'. My little room upstairs with a high unscreened window of only one sash didn't cool off until about midnight. Then, I could go to sleep.<br><br>I knew the reason that all the rural schools had to begin in July, though the farmers had objected because they needed their children at home to help with farm work. Rural schools began early because coal was an added expense for winter months. The county schools all over the state had barely enough funds to keep them going, and ii they could have school during the hot months it sheared away a great expense from their budgets. But it was hard on the children and the teachers.<br><br>The first bucket of water Guy and Ova brought didn't last five minutes. The majority of the pupils were still thirsty. I sent Guy and Ova back for more, telling them to borrow another bucket. I sent them in a hurry. And I knew I had to do something about the dipper problem. At Plum Grove, too, we had all drunk from the same dipper, but when I went to Landsburgh High School I was taught something different.<br><br>So I made "an important announcement" to my pupils. I told them each had to bring his own drinking cup the next day. It could be a glass, teacup, gourd, dipper, just so it was his own and no one else drank from it. My pupils looked at one another and laughed as if my announcement was funny. But I had seen sweat run from their faces into the dipper, and the next in line put his mouth where the sweat had run or where the other pupil had put his lips. I noticed, too, several pupils had put the rim up near the handle to their mouths, so I knew they didn't like to drink after the others.<br><br>On Tuesday they brought their dippers, tin cups, and glasses. Only a few had forgotten, and I stopped with my busy schedule of class work long enough to teach them how to make paper drinking cups. I showed them how to take a clean sheet of paper from a tablet and fold it to hold water. I gave them a lecture about drinking water. I told them never to drink from a stream. I told them how I had gotten typhoid fever twice: once from drinking cool water from a little stream, and once from drinking in a river. I had my pupils use the dipper to dip water from the bucket into their cups. They accepted my suggestion gladly. I also borrowed another water bucket from Bertha Conway and brought it to school. The one bucket allowed me for thirty-five pupils (and there would be more as soon as the farmers were through with their summer plowing and worming and suckering tobacco, stripping their cane and boiling the juice to syrup) was not enough. They played hard at recess and noon and in the "time of books" sat in a schoolroom almost as hot as a stove oven.<br><br>Tuesday when I stood beside Guy Hawkins and showed him how to hold his book when he read, my pupils laughed until I had to stop them. I was trying to teach Guy to read as he stumbled over the simple words in the <i>First Grade Reader.</i> My pupils laughed because Guy was taller by two inches than I was and heavier. He had a bullneck almost as large as his head, and a prominent jaw. His beard was so heavy that he had to shave every day.<br><br>Wouldn't Coach Wilson like to have him!

His trouble begins when he saves a neighbor's daughter from the violent advances of two upper-class men. Then he rescues an actual rape victim he finds unconscious in an alley, a blackstaffer -- a young expatriate mage -- from Recluce, and that makes his wife very uneasy. The culprit in both cases turns out to have been Egen, the cruel and corrupt son of the local ruler. When the blackstaffer is mysteriously murdered in Kharl's cooperage, Kharl is jailed, tried, and flogged, and in a shocking turnaround released--and his consort executed for the murder, which she did not commit. Egen again. Kharl ends up on the run, with just a handful of coins and a few clothes, but he also takes the slain woman's black staff and her book, <i>The Basis of Order</i>, which explains the principles of its power. The diligent cooper is about to learn a new, very different skill.<br><br><i>Wellspring of Chaos</i> is the twelfth book in the Recluce Saga and takes place roughly 60 years after the close of <i>The Order War </i>(Recluce #4).

He lives in Cedar City, Utah.</p>I <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Kharl stood at the front window of his shop, looking westward for a moment at the wedge of twilight sky visible between the slate roofs of the buildings on the far side of the narrow Crafters' Lane. A single lamp was visible through the middle window of Gharan's quarters, above the weaver's shop. Next door, at Hamyl's, both the lower floor and the rooms above were dark. That wasn't surprising, Kharl told himself, since Hamyl's consort had taken the children to her parents' holding to help with the early-midsummer gathering. That had left the potter free to indulge himself at the Tankard, and the lane peaceful, since Kharl's neighbor, the scrivener Tyrbel, was a widower and kept a quiet establishment. <br>Lowering his eyes, the cooper glanced at the five barrels in his display, all tight cooperage from the best white oak, ranging from the hogshead to the standard barrel and down to the quarter barrel and the fine-finished fifth barrel with the brass spigot, used by anyone who wanted to store and dispense expensive liquids, mostly spirits. Then he barred the front door and closed the shutters behind the lead-glassed panes that his grandsire had installed before Kharl had been born. At that time, glass windows had been considered particularly foolish for a cooper, unlike a goldsmith or an artisan--or even a weaver or a potter--who had to display work to attract buyers. Times had changed, and most shops along the lane had come to display their wares behind windows. <br>"A barrel's a barrel. So's a hogshead. People buy barrels because they need barrels." Kharl smiled as he recalled the acerbic words of his grandmother, who had never let his grandsire forget what she regarded as the foolishness of the glass. <br>Foolishness? Kharl didn't think so. He still got orders from passersby who otherwise hadn't thought about barrels. Not many, never more than one an eightday, and sometimes only a few a season. Over time, though, the windows had paid for themselves. <br>He picked up the lamp and walked toward the rear of the shop, past the high racks that held the billets he would form into staves. Most of the billets were oak, white for the tight cooperage and red for slack. There were also some billets of tight-grained black oak, and a few of chestnut. He passed the workbench and the tool rack, with every tool in place. On the left side of the rear wall was the small forge where he sized and shaped the hoops for tight cooperage. Beside the forge on the brick flooring was the fire pot and, beside it, the steaming ring. The faintest smell of ashes and charcoal drifted toward Kharl from the banked coals of the forge. <br>Just short of the rear wall, and the door to the loading dock, the cooper stopped and looked at the fifteen white oak barrels waiting there. Each was identical to the next, with the iron bands, set just so, and the smooth finish, with a medium toasting on the inside. Korlan was supposed to pick them up in the morning--pick them up and pay the balance due. The vintner had taken the first fifteen barrels an eightday earlier. Kharl only hoped that the vintner did not come up with some excuse, as he had the summer before, waiting almost two eightdays before showing up, but, then, that was the problem in dealing with someone who lived more than ten kays to the south of Brysta. <br>Kharl half smiled, then nodded, and turned, the carry-lamp in hand, to head up the stairs. <br>&nbsp; <br>"&#x2026;silvers and coppers are not for me, <br>but a pretty girl whose charms are free&#x2026;" <br>&nbsp; <br>He frowned. Had he heard singing in the alley? The Tankard was four doors toward the harbor, but seldom did roisterers come wandering down the alley, even early in the evening. Kharl cocked his head. <br>&nbsp; <br>"&#x2026;for when there's no lamps to see, <br>any woman's as fair as fair can be&#x2026;" <br>&nbsp; <br>"No&#x2026;let go of me!" <br>The woman's voice--no, it was a girl's voice--was familiar, but Kharl could not place it. He moved to the far side of the loading dock and swept up the cudgel in his left hand, then, leaving the lamp behind, eased the door open. <br>"Let me go!" <br>"&#x2026;mean you no harm, little woman." A raucous laugh followed. "We'll even pay you for what you give others for free&#x2026;" <br>"Let go! Let&#x2026;mmmpphhh&#x2026;" The girl's words were choked off. <br>Kharl closed the door behind him so that he would not be silhouetted by the light from the lamp. He glanced toward the Tankard, but saw no one. He looked back to the north. There, less than a rod away, perhaps less than ten cubits, in the fading light and the dimness of the alley, were three figures that Kharl could barely make out. Two men held the girl, a thin figure with dark ringlets over a green summer blouse. The hair and the blouse belonged to Sanyle, the youngest of Tyrbel's daughters. <br>One of the men had Sanyle's arms cruelly twisted behind her, and the other had his hand on her shoulder, pulling the summer blouse down. Both men were laughing. <br>Kharl took three quick steps, then two more, bringing the cudgel up. <br>The nearer man, the one who had started to rip away Sanyle's blouse, turned. A blade hissed from the scabbard at his belt. <br>Kharl took another step and struck the blade and the man's hand with the cudgel before the man had finished turning toward the cooper. The shortsword dropped on the cobblestones of the alley with a muffled <i>clank</i>. <br>"Ah&#x2026;swine-slime&#x2026;misbegotten&#x2026;" The youth jumped back, cradling his hand. The dark blue velvet of his tunic was almost lost in the dimness. <br>The second man let go of Sanyle, and his right hand darted toward the hilt of his blade. <br>"Don't&#x2026;" growled the cooper. "'Less you want a broken arm. Just let her go, and back away and head back where you came from. Have fun with your own or those you pay." <br>As soon as the man had released her, Sanyle slipped away into the shadows. There was a glint on the heavy brass key she held, and then the rear door of the structure beside the cooperage opened, and quickly shut. <br>"You can't do this." The taller young man, who was still half a head shorter than the cooper, kept his hand on the hilt of his blade, but did not draw it. "You don't know who you're talking to&#x2026;" <br>"Doesn't matter," growled the cooper. "Don't force girls barely old enough to know the difference 'tween boys and men." <br>"They're all the same." <br>Kharl raised the cudgel slightly. "Back off, little man, 'less you never want to use that arm again." <br>The shorter youth scooped up the fallen blade with his left hand and backed away. After a moment, the taller one followed. <br>Kharl stood watching until the two were out of sight, and until the alley was quiet once more. Then he turned and reentered the cooperage, wondering from what merchants' houses had come the overdressed and spoiled youths. With a snort, he set down the heavy cudgel and barred the door. <br>After reclaiming the lamp, he started up the steps to the quarters above the cooperage. His boots thumped heavily on the wood, and the fourth step creaked, as it had for years. <br>Charee stood just inside the door at the top of the stairs. Shoulder-length black hair was bound back from her face, making it seem even narrower than it was. Her green eyes were cool. "Your supper's cold. Thought you were coming up sooner." <br>"I was. Heard something out back. Wanted to make sure that it wasn't someone trying to break in. Just a pair of youngsters thought they were men, drinking too much for ones so young." Kharl had no intention of saying more about the would-be bravos. For all her virtues, Charee lacked one--that of circumspection. The young men could scarcely have picked out one crafter in gray from another, not unless Charee told the entire lane. Because she well might have, while suggesting that Kharl was being foolish, Kharl saw little point in calling attention to the incident. Sanyle would doubtless tell her widower father, but the scrivener was more than taciturn, as were his children. <br>"Won't you ever leave well enough alone, Kharl? Leave the roisterers alone. Or if you must, call them to the attention of Lord West's Watch. That's what he draws his tariffs for. You've got a consort and sons that need you&#x2026;" <br>"My hard-won coins, leastwise." Kharl shut the door to the stairs and the shop below and walked toward the washroom on the right side of the landing. <br>"Let's not be starting that again." <br>Kharl forced a smile. "I won't, dearest. I need to wash up." The pitcher on the wash table was full, and the basin empty and clean, with a worn but clean gray towel and a narrow bar of fat soap laid out on the left side. He closed the washroom door and began to wash, enjoying the faint rose scent that came from the petals in the soap. It took time to get the sawdust off his face and hands and arms, and out of his dark beard, short-cropped as it was. <br>When Kharl stepped into the main room, it was still warm from the day, but the harbor breeze blowing through the open windows offered a welcoming coolness, even if it did bear the scents of salt and fish and caused the two wall lamps to flicker. <br>The cooper walked toward the round table where Arthal and Warrl waited, their eyes following him, but not exactly looking at him. <br>"Did you finish your lessons?" Kharl's eyes fixed on Warrl, his younger son, by three years. <br>"Yes, ser. I did." After a moment, the younger boy asked, "How much longer will I have to go to Master Fonwyl?" <br>"Until he says you can read and write well enough to pass the craft-master's tests." Kharl seated himself. <br>"I don't see why," interrupted Arthal. "It's not as though we'll ever have the golds to post the bond for mastercrafter." <br>"Maybe so, and maybe not," replied Kharl. "But if you get the chance, I don't want you looking back and complaining that I didn't prepare you. Reading and writing aren't something you can pick up easy-like when you're older." <br>"But what use is it if you're not a mastercrafter or a merchant or a lord? You scarce have a chance to read a broadsheet--" <br>"But I can, and once or twice it's saved me good coins. Enough." Kharl managed not to snap. "Let's enjoy supper." <br>As if she had been waiting for them to stop, Charee lifted the heavy cast-iron stewpot off the stove and carried it to the table. There, she set it on the well-browned trivet in the center of the oval oak table that had been one of the first pieces of actual furniture that Kharl had made after he had taken over the cooperage. <br>His consort set the large basket of afternoon-baked bread on the table and seated herself at the opposite end of the oval table from Kharl. Kharl began to ladle the stew into the chipped brown crockery bowls that had come from Charee's mother. <br>"Smells good," offered Kharl. <br>"It does," added Warrl. <br>"More summer squash and potatoes than meat," murmured Arthal. <br>"It's tasty, and it's hot, and you didn't have to spend the day cooking it," Kharl pointed out. "If you'd rather not eat, you can leave the table right now." <br>"No, Da&#x2026;I'm sorry, Ma." Arthal's voice was barely apologetic. <br>Kharl didn't feel like calling his older son on his borderline rudeness, not after a long day finishing the last of the barrels for Korlan, especially when he knew that Arthal would just make some other comment. <br>"What was going on outside, Da?" asked Warrl. <br>"Just some young fellows who'd had too much at the Tankard. Had more ale than sense, and didn't know it." <br>"Will the Watch catch them?" <br>"They settled down," Kharl said, after taking a mouthful of the stew, still warm and peppery, despite Charee's comments about it getting cold. "Good stew." He broke off a chunk of the crusty bread, then dipped it into the stew before chewing off the dipped end. "Good bread." <br>"They'd better settle down," offered Arthal. "Lord West likes Brysta peaceful." <br>"The justicers worry more about thieves and killers," Kharl said, taking a swallow of the warm ale, really only about half a mug for each of them, but that had been all that was left in the quarter barrel in the cellar, and he couldn't afford any more--not until Korlan paid him for the wine barrels. <br>"Cossal said they hung three brigands in the Justicers' Hall on twoday," added Warrl. "He was there." <br>"They hung three men. That's true. They might even have been guilty." Kharl had his doubts that everyone hanged was as guilty as charged. <br>"Does it matter, if one brigand is strung up for something he didn't do?" asked Charee. "Anyone they catch has done more than enough anyway. Weren't for Lord West, we'd have thieves overrunning Brysta, like in his sire's time." <br>"That was a different time," Kharl said. "Fairven had fallen. The more powerful steam engines had exploded. Many trading ventures had failed. People were starving, and white wizards were everywhere." <br>"Better the whites than those blackstaffers from Recluce," Charee sniffed. "Them and their fine clothes, and their noses in the air. Think they know everything. Father Jorum says that we're all equal in the eyes of the Sovereign." <br>Kharl wasn't about to get into debating the opinions of the priest of the one-god believers. "I can't see as they harm anyone, but it's better that they stay in Recluce." He took another chunk of bread and wiped out his empty bowl with it. "Good dinner, dearest." <br>"How would we know? The lords won't touch 'em, not unless they're caught doing something right awful. Merayni, she listened to one of 'em, last winter's end it was, and he was telling terrible tales. Terrible tales." <br>"What kind of tales?" asked Kharl, in spite of himself. He had his doubts about Charee's older sister Merayni, although Merayni was certainly good-hearted, and she and her consort were more than successful with the pearapple and peach orchard that Dowsyl had inherited from his father. He paused. "Didn't know blackstaffers got so far south as Peachill or Eolya." <br>"They get everywhere, Merayni was saying, and the tales he told! Terrible, she said. About how a body can't even walk across some hills in Candar without turnin' black and shriveling up and dyin' right there on the spot." <br>"That may be," Kharl replied. "That's Candar, and not Nordla. Lord West is lucky to have one or two wizards that he can count on. Rather have him with wizards than some of the other Lords of the Quadrant." <br>"This young blackstaffer, he said that the lord's wizards weren't proper mages. 'A course, Father Jorum says all wizardry is evil." <br>"I wouldn't know if they're proper wizards." Kharl tilted his mug to get the last drop of ale. "I'm a cooper, not a wizard or a lord. That's their business. Mine's barrels. Solid barrels." <br>"Terrible stuff, magery." Charee sniffed again. "As bad as thieves and brigands, if you ask me." <br>"I'm sure there are good mages and bad ones. There are good lords and bad ones, good coopers and bad ones." <br>"No such thing as a good mage, if you ask me. Lord West can have them all. Be better if he hung 'em." <br>...</p><h2>Hampton Court Palace: The Official Illustrated History</h2><p>Tells the compelling story of one of the finest palaces in Europe, situated on the banks of the River Thames south-west of London and a centre of court life in England from 1529 to 1737.

She lives in Oslo with her family.The Lion&#x2019;s Mouth FRIDAY, APRIL 4, 1997<p></p> 6:47 P.M., PRIME MINISTER&#x2019;S OFFICE (PMO)<p></p> <br>She wore a blue suit, the woman who sat doing nothing outside the prime minister&#x2019;s office; she just sat there, with a mounting sense of disquiet, staring alternately at the double doors and her own telephone. Her neat little jacket was of classic cut, with a matching skirt, and was topped off by an overly gaudy scarf. Although it was close to the end of a long workday, not a single hair was out of place in her elegant, if somewhat dated, coiffure. The hairstyle made her appear older than she actually was, and that might have been the intention, as if the fact that it had gone out of fashion in the early 1980s&#x2014;feather-cut at the sides, with a full crown&#x2014;somehow endowed her with a gravitas that her forty-plus years did not.<br> <br>She had more than enough to do, but uncharacteristically, she couldn&#x2019;t settle down to anything. For some considerable time, she just sat there. Only her fingers betrayed her steadily rising sense that something was terribly wrong. They were long and beautifully manicured, with crimson nails and two gold rings on each hand, and they touched her temple at regular intervals, as though to tidy some invisible disorderly strands, before tapping the blotting pad with a hollow sound, like a series of shots fired using a silencer. Suddenly the woman stood up and crossed to the west-facing window.<br> <br>It was twilight outside. April promised to be just as capricious as Bj�rnstjerne Bj�rnson, author of the Norwegian national anthem, had once described it many years earlier. Fifteen floors below, she saw people shivering as they hurried along Akersgata&#x2014;the street where both the country&#x2019;s government and Oslo&#x2019;s newspapers had their headquarters&#x2014;some of them walking irritably in circles as they waited for a bus that might never come. There was still a light on in the culture minister&#x2019;s office across the road in the R5 building. Despite the distance, the woman in the blue suit could see the secretary walking from the anteroom to her boss with a sheaf of papers. Tossing her blond hair, the young cabinet minister laughed in response to the older woman. She was too young to be culture minister. Not tall enough, either. An evening gown did not sit becomingly on a woman of barely five foot three. To crown it all, the young woman lit a cigarette, and placed an ashtray on top of the pile of papers.<br> <br>She shouldn&#x2019;t smoke in that office, thought the woman in blue. The finest cultural treasures are hanging in there. It can&#x2019;t be doing the paintings any good. And it can&#x2019;t be very safe either.<br> <br>She embraced the feeling of irritation with gratitude. It momentarily distracted her from the sense of disquiet that was about to tip over into unfamiliar and distressing anxiety.<br> <br>Two hours had passed since Prime Minister Birgitte Volter had said, very specifically, almost coldly, that she was not to be disturbed, no matter what. That was what she had said: &#x201c;No matter what.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gro Harlem Brundtland, the previous prime minister, had never said, &#x201c;No matter what.&#x201d; She would have said, &#x201c;Regardless of the reason,&#x201d; or perhaps simply left it at that: she was not to be disturbed. Even if all seventeen stories of the government building went up in flames, Gro Harlem Brundtland would have been left in peace if she had given that instruction. But Gro had stepped down on October 25 of the previous year, and these were new times, with new methods and new jargon, and Wenche Andersen kept her emotions to herself. She carried out her work as she always did: effectively and discreetly.<br> <br>It was well over an hour since Supreme Court Judge Benjamin Grinde had left the office. Clad in a charcoal-gray Italian suit, he had nodded as he emerged through the double doors and closed them behind him. Smiling faintly, he had indulged in a flattering remark about her new outfit before he had disappeared downstairs to the elevator on the fourteenth floor, carrying his burgundy leather briefcase under his arm. Wenche Andersen had automatically risen to her feet to take a cup of coffee in to Birgitte Volter, when at the last minute she had fortunately remembered her boss&#x2019;s resolute instruction about peace and quiet.<br> <br>However, it really was starting to get extremely late now.<br> <br>The undersecretaries and political advisers had left, as had the rest of the office staff. Wenche Andersen was sitting alone on a Friday evening on the fifteenth floor of the tower block in the government complex and did not know what to do. There was total silence from the prime minister&#x2019;s office. Maybe that was not so strange after all, because of the double doors.<br> 7:02 P.M., ODINS GATE 3<p></p> <br>There was definitely something wrong with the contents of the plain, tulip-shaped crystal glass. He held it up to see how the light refracted in the red liquid. He tried to take his time listening to the wine, attempted to relax and enjoy it, as full-bodied Bordeaux normally deserved. The 1983 vintage was supposed to be friendly and inviting. This one was far too tight in its initial phase, and he pursed his lips in astonished disgust as it dawned on him that the flavor of its finish in no way matched the price he had paid for the bottle. Abruptly setting down his glass, he grabbed the TV remote control. The evening news had already started, but the broadcast was completely banal, and the images flickered past without him noticing anything other than that the reporter&#x2019;s togs were thoroughly tasteless. A yellow jacket was quite simply not suitable male attire.<br> <br>He had been compelled to do it. There had been no other option. Now that it was all over, he felt nothing. He had expected some kind of relief, the opportunity to breathe easily after all these years.<br> <br>He really wanted to feel relieved, but instead he was gripped by an unfamiliar sense of loneliness. The furniture surrounding him suddenly seemed alien. As a child, he had often climbed on the heavy old oak sideboard decorated with carved bunches of grapes; it now dominated his own living room in all its grandeur, and he kept his exclusive collection of Japanese netsuke miniatures behind its polished glass doors, but today it seemed only gloomy and threatening.<br> <br>One object lay on the table between him and the remote control. He did not understand what it was doing there. Why he had brought it with him was a mystery.<br> <br>Giving himself a shake, he switched off the Dagsrevy reporter with a tap of his finger. Tomorrow was his birthday, when he would turn fifty. He felt much older than that as he strained stiffly to rise from the chesterfield sofa and walk through to the kitchen. The p�t� could, and ought, to be made tonight. It would be at its best after twenty-four hours in a refrigerator.<br> <br>For a second or two he considered opening another bottle of the wretched Bordeaux. Then he pushed the thought aside and contented himself with a cognac poured generously into a fresh glass. Cooking cognac.<br> <br>There was no relief to be found in the cognac either.<br> 7:35 P.M., PMO<p></p> <br>Her hair was no longer so perfect. A brittle, bleached lock fell across her eyes, and she felt beads of perspiration on her top lip. Nervously clutching her handbag, she opened it to find a freshly ironed handkerchief, which she held to her mouth before using it to mop her forehead.<br> <br>Now she would go in. Something could be wrong. Birgitte Volter had disconnected the phone, so she would have to knock on the door. The prime minister might be ill; she had seemed stressed recently. Although Wenche Andersen had considerable reservations about Birgitte Volter&#x2019;s rather reckless, unfamiliar style, she had to acknowledge that the prime minister was usually very friendly. During the past week, however, Birgitte Volter had been verging on dismissive; she had been irritable and sometimes even exasperated. Was she unwell?<br> <br>Now she would enter. Now.<br> <br>Instead of disturbing the prime minister, she paid another visit to the restroom. But although she lingered in front of the mirror, she couldn&#x2019;t find anything that needed attending to. She spent a long time washing her hands, then fished out a little tube of hand cream from the closet underneath the sink. It was unnecessary and made her hands feel sticky, but putting it on used up some time. Massaging her fingers thoroughly, she felt the cream penetrate the surface of her skin. Involuntarily she looked at her watch once more, and breathed heavily. Only four and a half minutes had passed. The tiny golden hands almost seemed to be standing still. Anxious and resigned, she returned to her seat; even the sound of the restroom door slamming behind her seemed alarming.<br> <br>Now she simply must go in. Wenche Andersen attempted to stand up but stopped halfway, hesitating, and sat down again. The instruction had been crystal clear. Birgitte Volter was not to be disturbed. &#x201c;No matter what.&#x201d; But nor had the prime minister said that Wenche Andersen could go home, and it would be unheard of to leave the office before she had been given permission to do so. Now she would go in. She must go in.<br> <br>With her hand on the door handle, she placed her ear against the door panel. Not a sound. Tentatively, she tapped her index finger on the wood. Still not a sound. She opened the outer door and repeated the action. It did not help: no one said, &#x201c;Come in!&#x201d; or &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t disturb me!&#x201d; No one said anything at all, and now it wasn&#x2019;t just Wenche Andersen&#x2019;s upper lip that was perspiring. Cautiously and hesitantly, ready to close the door again as quick as a flash if the prime minister was sitting there deep in concentration on something or other of great importance, she opened the door a tiny crack. However, from where she stood, looking through a gap that was no more than a few inches wide, she could see only the far end of the sitting area and the circular table.<br> <br>All of a sudden, Wenche Andersen was seized with a decisiveness that had eluded her for several hours, and she threw the door open wide.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; she said loudly. &#x201c;Sorry for disturbing you, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was no point in saying anything further.<br> <br>Prime Minister Birgitte Volter was sitting in her office chair, her upper body slumped across the desk. She looked like a student in a luxurious reading room, late one evening right before exams, just taking a little nap, forty winks. Wenche Andersen stood in the doorway a good six yards away, but she could see it all the same. The blood was clearly visible; it had formed a large, stagnant pool on a draft of the proposal concerning the Schengen agreement&#x2014;so visible that Wenche Andersen did not even cross over to her dead boss to see if she could possibly help her, fetch a glass of water perhaps or provide her with a handkerchief to wipe away the mess.<br> <br>Instead, she carefully&#x2014;but this time very determinedly&#x2014;closed the doors of the prime minister&#x2019;s office, skirted around her own desk, and grabbed the phone with the direct line to the central switchboard of Oslo Police Headquarters. It rang only once before a man&#x2019;s voice answered.<br> <br>&#x201c;You have to come right away,&#x201d; Wenche Andersen said, her voice trembling only ever so slightly. &#x201c;The Prime Minister is dead. She&#x2019;s been shot. Birgitte Volter has been killed. You must come.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then she put down the receiver, moved her hand to another telephone, and this time got the security switchboard on the line.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s office,&#x201d; she said, more calmly now. &#x201c;Shut the building. No one in, no one out. Only the police. Remember the garage.&#x201d;<br> <br>Without waiting for a response, she disconnected the call in order to dial another four-digit number.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fourteenth floor,&#x201d; answered the man on the floor below from within a cage of bulletproof glass, the chamber that allowed access up into the holy of holies, the offices of the head of government of the Kingdom of Norway.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s office,&#x201d; she said yet again. &#x201c;The Prime Minister is dead. Activate the emergency plan.&#x201d;<br> <br>And so Wenche Andersen continued her duties as she always did: systematically and faultlessly. The only clues that this was a quite extraordinary Friday evening were the two expanding lilac patches on her cheeks.<br> <br>They soon spread across her whole face.<br> 7:50 P.M., KVELDSAVISEN EDITORIAL OFFICE<p></p> <br>When &#x201c;Little&#x201d; Lettvik&#x2019;s parents christened their blond-haired baby girl Lise Annette, they failed to anticipate that her sister, older by one year, would naturally nickname her &#x201c;Little&#x201d; or that fifty-four years later Little would weigh two hundred pounds and smoke twenty cigarillos a day. Nor could they have predicted that she would push her exhausted liver to the limits by drinking a daily dram of whiskey. Her entire body invited ridicule: she still adhered to the 1970s rule about going braless, and her stringy gray hair framed a face that bore signs of almost thirty years in Akersgata. But no one cracked a joke about Little Lettvik. At least not in her company.<br> <br>&#x201c;What the fuck&#x2019;s a Supreme Court judge doing at the Prime Minister&#x2019;s office late on a Friday afternoon?&#x201d; she muttered to herself as she hoisted up her breasts, which were spilling out in the direction of her armpits, finally finding support on her well-upholstered pelvic bone.<br> <br>&#x201c;What did you say?&#x201d;<br> <br>The young man facing her was her lapdog. He was six foot four, emaciated, and still suffered from acne. Little Lettvik despised people like Knut Fagerborg: boys with six-month temporary contracts at Kveldsavisen. They were the most dangerous journalists in the world; Little Lettvik knew that. She had once been in that position herself, and although it was a long time ago and circumstances in the Norwegian press had completely altered since then, she recognized him. But Knut was useful. Like all the others, he admired her without reservation. He thought she would make sure his contract was extended. In that, he was totally mistaken. However, for the moment, he had his uses.<br> <br>&#x201c;Strange,&#x201d; she murmured again, really more to herself than in reply to Knut Fagerborg. &#x201c;I phoned Grinde at the Supreme Court this afternoon. It&#x2019;s so bloody difficult to find out anything about what that commission of his is up to. A young chick in his office chirped that he was with the Prime Minister. Why in hell was he there?&#x201d;<br> <br>Raising her arms above her head, she stretched, and Knut recognized the scent of Poison. Not so long ago, he had been forced to pay a visit to the emergency doctor for antihistamines after a one-night stand with a woman who had the same taste.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; she said suddenly, as though she had just noticed him.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something going on. The police radio went berserk at first, and now it&#x2019;s totally silent. I&#x2019;ve never known anything like it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Truth to tell, twenty-year-old Knut Fagerborg had not experienced very much in his short life. However, Little was in agreement: it did seem odd.<br> <br>&#x201c;Heard anything on the street?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Guys!&#x201d;<br> <br>A man in his forties, wearing a gray tweed jacket, came shuffling into the editorial office.<br> <br>&#x201c;Something&#x2019;s going on in the government tower block. A great commotion and lots of vehicles, and they&#x2019;re cordoning off the entire place. Is the Prime Minister expecting some hotshot from abroad?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;At night? On a Friday night?&#x201d;<br> <br>Little Lettvik&#x2019;s left knee was aching.<br> <br>She had experienced pain in her left knee two hours before the Kielland oil rig disaster in the North Sea. Her knee had also been excruciating the day before the murder of Swedish Prime Minister ...</p><h2>Missouri Botanical Garden Climatron: A Celebration of 50 Years</h2><p>The Climatron� is perhaps the most iconic and famed building at the Missouri Botanical Garden, noted as the first geodesic dome to be used as a greenhouse when constructed in 1960. It was named one of the 100 most significant architectural achievements in U.S. history by the U.S. Bicentennial Commission of Architects. The free-standing structure, designed by St. Louis architects Murphy and Mackey, incorporates the principles of R. Buckminster Fuller, who patented the geodesic dome design. Archival photos convey the story of the plans, people, art, architecture and engineering that went into the iconic structure, while contemporary pictures provide a glimpse of the Climatron as enjoyed today.

Forged antiquities. A country at war. A camel in the garden. A cameo by Lawrence of Arabia. Add in Peters&#x2019;s trademark intelligent plotting, engaging characters, and stylish writing and we can hardly ask for anything more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most beloved characters in mystery/suspense fiction, archeologist and Egyptologist Amelia Peabody bravely faces gravest peril in Cairo on the eve of World War One in <i>New York Times </i>bestselling Grandmaster Elizabeth Peters&#x2019;s magnificent Egyptian adventure, <i>He Shall Thunder in the Sky.</i> The <i>San Francisco Examiner </i>calls these heart-racing exploits of Amelia and her courageous family, the Emersons, &#x201c;pure delight.&#x201d; But perhaps the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> states it best: &#x201c;Between Amelia Peabody and Indiana Jones, it&#x2019;s Amelia&#x2014;in wit and daring&#x2014;by a landslide.&#x201d;</p></p><p><i>He Shall Thunder in the Sky</i> completes an internal quartet (which also includes <i>Seeing a Large Cat</i>, <i>The Ape Who Guards the Balance</i>, and <i>The Falcon at the Portal</i>) within Elizabeth Peters's legendary series starring Amelia Peabody, the intrepid Edwardian Egyptologist, her husband, Emerson, and her extended family. The quartet comprises not only Amelia's diary of those years but also parts of a mysterious "Manuscript H," an omniscient viewpoint that allows a glimpse into the minds of Amelia's son--the dashing and brilliant Ramses--and her ward, Nefret Forth, as they mature into adults with their own secrets and agendas. <i>The Falcon at the Portal</i> left readers hanging impatiently in the enormous rift that book's events gouged between Ramses and Nefret, both madly in love but unrelentingly proud. <p> The winter of 1914-15 finds the Peabody-Emerson family back in Cairo--now under British martial law, with the Suez Canal under constant threat of attack from the Ottoman Empire. The city's young Englishmen are rushing to enlist, except for Ramses, who is widely scorned for his pacifism. Yet Amelia and Emerson soon find out that Ramses is (literally) playing a mysterious and potentially explosive part in the conflict between Egyptian nationalists and the British authorities, for reasons both political and familial. Nefret, for her part, is still running a health clinic for the city's fallen women and trying to avoid the attentions of Percy, Amelia's odious nephew. In the meantime, the Emersons' excavations at Giza reveal an unexpected treasure so remarkable that the uneasy Amelia immediately senses the fine hand of Sethos, the Master Criminal (who through many previous books has alternately plagued her and protested his boundless affection for her), at work. The climax and denouement are entirely worth the price of admission--tying up a decade's worth of loose strings and explaining some nagging points so subtle that less observant readers might easily have missed them. It's Peters's great gift that in the grand scheme of things, no clues are wasted. Her plotting is wonderfully complex and intriguing, and it fits seamlessly into the detailed historical background she builds so carefully. It may have taken years for her to complete this four-part dance (she promises more Amelia Peabody mysteries in the future), but she's charmed us right out of our dancing slippers along the way. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p><p>Trouble is brewing in Egypt at the close of 1914 and no one will escape the fury of the tempest to come. With the world around them at war, Amelia Peabody and her husband Radcliffe Emerson have returned to Cairo for another season of archaeological excavation -- despite the increasing danger of an attack on the Suez Canal and on Egypt itself.</p><p>A terrible conflict looms. A long-simmering love affair is resolved. A dastardly plot twists like a serpent writhing in the desert sun. There is no escaping the onrushing hurricane that now threatens the Emersons and their world -- so Amelia plunges right into it.</p></p><h2>Succeeding Generations: Realizing the Dream of Families in Business</h2><p>Finding the right successor to a well-loved founder or president is often the most difficult task an organization can face&#x2014;and the challenge can be even greater for family-run businesses. <i>Succeeding Generations</i> explores leadership transitions in family businesses, offering a clear-eyed assessment of the different options, from direct succession to building partnerships between siblings and cousins.<br><br>Family-owned companies may dominate the worldwide business landscape, yet surprisingly few are successfully passed down from one generation to the next, and fewer still reach the third generation intact. Author Ivan Lansberg, an organizational psychologist who grew up in a family business, examines the reasons behind this high failure rate and reveals the factors that contribute to long-term success. He offers practical advice on how to mentor successors, how to set up a systematic selection process, and how to make the best use of the board of directors during times of transition.<br><br>With a wealth of examples from companies in the United States, Europe, and Latin America, <i>Succeeding Generations</i> provides a thoughtful and comprehensive look at the sensitive dynamics of leadership succession in family businesses.</p><p><b>Ivan Lansberg</b>, a coauthor of <i>Generation to Generation</i>, is a principle of Lansberg, Gersick and Associates and cofounder of the Family Firm Institute.</p><h2>Fighting Spirit: The Memoirs of Major Yoshitaka Horie and the Battle of Iwo Jima</h2><p><i>Fighting Spirit</i> is essential reading for anyone interested in the Battle of Iwo Jima and the Pacific War. Maj. Horie was one of only four Japanese field grade officers directly associated with the Battle of Iwo Jima who survived. He was the only officer known to have left memoirs. Having served as a liaison officer with the Navy, Major Horie described in detail the respective positions, ideas, and assumptions that both the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy had when executing the Pacific War, the personalities involved, and the challenges they faced. He was a specialist in logistics and headed Lt. Gen. Kuribayashi's detached headquarters on Chichi Jima, located between Iwo Jima and mainland Japan. He was however intimately involved in planning the battle, and used his experience as a liaison to the Imperial Navy to share information and insights through his contacts. He was also very much aware of the limits to Japan's strategy. <br><p><i>Fighting Spirit</i> is an annotated translation of the memoirs of Imperial Japanese Army Major Yoshitaka Horie, co-edited by a USMC veteran of the Battle of Iwo Jima and an American academic who is a specialist on U.S.-Japan relations. Maj. Horie's book was first published in 1965, on the 20th anniversary of the battle. It was his desire to have it published in English, but he passed away in 2003 before seeing his dream realized. In addition to the 19 chapters of Horie's original work, the book includes an Editors' Preface, which provides biographical information on Maj. Horie and the context of the book, and two appendices of materials prepared by Maj. Horie shortly after the end of the war.</p></p><p>Robert D.

He now resides in Stockton, CAThis memoir by one of the very few Japanese planners to survive the Battle of Iwo Jima paints a vivid and deeply moving portrait of its defenders. By laying bare their complex personalities, emotions, and loyalties, it disproves the notion that Japanese fighting men were simply fanatics. Anyone who wants to understand the fighting spirit that led to their deaths, doomed their empire to defeat, and powered postwar Japan to greatness should read this book. ---ROGER DINGMAN, author of <i>Deciphering the Rising Sun: Navy and Marine Corps Codebreakers, Translators, and Interpreters in the Pacific War</i><br><br>Iwo Jima was the touchstone amphibious battle of the Pacific War. The U.S. story is well known, but we ve always lacked an authentic account in English of the Japanese commander's desperate decisions and wrenching compromises. Major Yoshitaka Horie's unique access to the commanding general throughout the battle provided the original breakthrough. By editing and annotating Horie's original memoirs so masterfully, Dr. Eldridge and Iwo veteran Tatum have produced a treasure trove of new insights and revelations. ---COL. JOSEPH H. ALEXANDER, USMC (RET.), author of <i>Utmost Savagery: The Three Days of Tarawa</i><br><br>Of all the major militaries of the twentieth century, the Japanese services are the least understood outside their home nation. Eldridge and Tatum have provided a major service in making these memoirs available in English. Horie emerges from this book as an exceptionally professional military officer who understood the use of military power on the ground and on the seas. His account of Iwo Jima is important because it discusses in a rational manner the Japanese defense of the island, and the reasons the cost of taking it was so high for the United States. His book offers major insights from the other side of the hill. ---NICHOLAS EVAN SARANTAKES, U.S. Naval War College, author of <i>Allies Against the Rising Sun: The United States, the British Nations, and the Defeat of Imperial Japan</i></p><h2>Ma Gastronomie</h2><p>First published in 1969, this landmark of French cuisine is back in print with an all-new edition featuring more than 200 of Point&#39;s remarkable, inventive recipes. 50 photos, 25 in color.</p><p>Fernand Point was just twenty-four when he opened the Restaurant de la Pyramide, just south of Lyon, France.

In this book,<i> </i>acclaimed historian Rashid Khalidi zeroes in on the United States&#x2019;s role as the purported impartial broker in this failed peace process. <br><br> Khalidi closely analyzes three historical moments that illuminate how the United States&#x2019; involvement has, in fact, thwarted progress toward peace between Israel and Palestine. The first moment he investigates is the &#x201c;Reagan Plan&#x201d; of 1982, when Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin refused to accept the Reagan administration&#x2019;s proposal to reframe the Camp David Accords more impartially. The second moment covers the period after the Madrid Peace Conference, from 1991 to 1993, during which negotiations between Israel and Palestine were brokered by the United States until the signing of the secretly negotiated Oslo accords. Finally, Khalidi takes on President Barack Obama&#x2019;s retreat from plans to insist on halting the settlements in the West Bank.<br><br> Through in-depth research into and keen analysis of these three moments, as well as his own firsthand experience as an advisor to the Palestinian delegation at the 1991 pre&#x2013;Oslo negotiations in Washington, DC, Khalidi reveals how the United States and Israel have actively colluded to prevent a Palestinian state and resolve the situation in Israel&#x2019;s favor. <i>Brokers of Deceit</i> bares the truth about why peace in the Middle East has been impossible to achieve: for decades, US policymakers have masqueraded as unbiased agents working to bring the two sides together, when, in fact, they have been the agents of continuing injustice, effectively preventing the difficult but essential steps needed to achieve peace in the region.</p><p><b>Rashid Khalidi </b>is the author of seven books about the Middle East, including <i>Palestinian Identity</i>,<i> Brokers of Deceit, Resurrecting Empire</i>, <i>The Iron Cage</i>, and <i>Sowing Crisis. </i>His writing on Middle Eastern history and politics has appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Boston Globe</i>,<i> Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, and many journals. For his work on the Middle East, Professor Khalidi has received fellowships and grants from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the American Research Center in Egypt, and the Rockefeller Foundation, among others. He is the Edward Said Professor of Modern Arab Studies&nbsp;at Columbia University in New York and is editor of the <i>Journal of Palestine Studies</i>. <br><b>DISHONEST BROKERS</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish</i><br> <i>thoughts. . . . If thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt</i><br> <i>thought. A bad usage can spread by tradition and imitation, even among</i><br> <i>people who should and do know better.</i><br> &#x2014;George Orwell, &#x201c;Politics and the English Language,&#x201d; 1946<br> &nbsp;<br> In politics and in diplomacy, as in much else, language matters greatly.<br> However debased political discourse may become, however disingenuous<br> diplomacy often is, the words employed by politicians and diplomats<br> defi ne situations and determine outcomes. In recent history, few<br> semantic battles over terminology have been as intensely fought out as<br> those concerning Palestine/Israel.<br> &nbsp;<br> The importance of the precise use of language can be illustrated by<br> the powerful valence in the Middle East context of terms such as &#x201c;terrorism,&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;security,&#x201d; &#x201c;self-determination,&#x201d; &#x201c;autonomy,&#x201d; &#x201c;honest broker,&#x201d;<br> and &#x201c;peace process.&#x201d; Each of these terms has set conditions not only for<br> perceptions, but also for possibilities. Moreover, these terms have come<br> to take on a specifi c meaning, frequently one that is heavily loaded in<br> favor of one side, and is far removed from what logic or balance would<br> seem to dictate. Thus in the American/Israeli offi cial lexicon, &#x201c;terrorism&#x201d;<br> in the Middle East context has come to apply <i>exclusively </i>to the<br> actions of Arab militants, whether those of the Palestine Liberation<br> Organization (PLO), Hamas, Hizballah, or others. Under these peculiar<br> terminological rules, the actions of the militaries of Israel and the<br> United States cannot be described as &#x201c;terrorism,&#x201d; irrespective of how<br> many Palestinians, Lebanese, Iraqi, or Afghan civilians may have died<br> at their hands.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Similarly, in this lexicon, &#x201c;security&#x201d; is an absolute priority of Israel&#x2019;s,<br> the need for which is invariably described as rooted in genuine, deepseated<br> existential fears. &#x201c;Israeli security&#x201d; therefore takes precedence<br> over virtually everything else, including international law and the human<br> rights of others. It is an endlessly expansive concept that includes<br> a remarkable multitude of things, such as whether pasta or generator<br> parts can be brought into the Gaza Strip, or whether miserably poor<br> Palestinian villagers can be allowed water cisterns.1 By contrast, in spite<br> of the precarious nature of their situation, Palestinians are presumed<br> not to have any signifi cant concerns about their security. This is the case<br> even though nearly half the Palestinian population have lived for more<br> than two generations under a grinding military occupation without the<br> most basic human, civil, or political rights, and the rest have for many<br> decades been dispersed from their ancestral homeland, many of them<br> living under harsh, authoritarian Arab governments.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book is concerned primarily, however, not with the misuse of<br> language, important though that is, but with an American-brokered political<br> process that for more than thirty-fi ve years has reinforced the subjugation<br> of the Palestinian people, provided Israel and the United States<br> with a variety of advantages, and made considerably more unlikely the<br> prospects of a just and lasting settlement of the confl ict between Israel<br> and the Arabs. This is the true nature of this process. Were this glaring<br> reality apparent to all, there might have been pressure for change. But<br> the distortion of language has made a crucially important contribution<br> to these outcomes, by &#x201c;corrupting thought,&#x201d; and thereby cloaking their<br> real nature. As we shall see in the pages that follow, language employed<br> in the Middle East political context&#x2014;terms like &#x201c;terrorism&#x201d; and &#x201c;security&#x201d;<br> and the others mentioned above&#x2014;has often been distorted and<br> then successfully employed to conceal what was actually happening.<br> &nbsp;<br> Where the Palestinians are concerned, time and again during their<br> modern history, corrupted phraseology has profoundly obscured reality.<br> The Zionist movement decisively established a discursive hegemony<br> early on in the confl ict with the Palestinians, thereby signifi cantly reinforcing<br> the existing power balance in its favor, and later in favor of the<br> state of Israel. This has placed the Palestinians at a lasting disadvantage,<br> as they have consistently been forced to compete within a fi eld whose<br> terms are largely defi ned by their opponents. Consider such potent canards<br> as &#x201c;making the desert bloom&#x201d;&#x2014;implying that the six hundred<br> thousand industrious Palestinian peasants and townspeople who inhabited<br> their homeland in the centuries before the relatively recent arrival<br> of modern political Zionism were desert nomads and wastrels&#x2014;and &#x201c;a<br> land without a people for a people without a land,&#x201d; which presumes the<br> nonexistence of an entire people.2 As the Palestinian literary and cultural<br> critic Edward Said aptly put it in 1988: &#x201c;It is by no means an exaggeration<br> to say that the establishment of Israel as a state in 1948 occurred<br> partly because the Zionists acquired control of most of the territory of<br> Palestine, and partly because they had already won the political battle<br> for Palestine in the international world in which ideas, representation,<br> rhetoric and images were at issue.&#x201d;3</p><h2>Chrislam: How Missionaries are Promoting an Islamized Gospel</h2><p>This important study engages the question of how much one can &amp; should remain connected to one's Muslim heritage as that Muslim comes to embrace Christ.

In the intervening period, many species of early ape and human have lived and died out, leaving behind the fossilized remains that have helped to make the detailed picture of our evolution revealed here.This exciting, up-to-the-minute account is divided into three accessible sections. "In Search of Our Ancestors" examines the contexts in which fossilized remains have been found and the techniques used to study them. "The Fossil Evidence" traces in detail the evolution of apes and humans, from Proconsul to the australopithecines, and Homo erectus to the Neanderthals and Homo sapiens. The latest fossil finds at major new sites such as Dmanisi in Georgia and Gran Dolina in Spain are appraised, and new advances in genetic studies, including the extraction of DNA from extinct human species, are evaluated. "Interpreting the Evidence" reconstructs and explains the evolution of human behavior, describing the development of tool use, the flourishing of the earliest artists, and the spread of modern humans to all corners of the world. The book is superbly illustrated with hundreds of photographs, diagrams, and specially commissioned reconstruction drawings by the artist John Sibbick. 430 illustrations, 175 in color</p><p><p><b>Chris Stringer</b> is Head of Human Origins at the Natural History Museum, London.</p><p><b>Peter Andrews</b> is the former Head of Human Origins at the Natural History Museum, London.</p>&#x201c;A spectacular, authoritative guide. . . .

Nor is it a major steel-producing country. Yet the <b>Swiss Army Knife</b>, originally produced by a Swiss master cutler for the Swiss armed forces, is now recognized throughout the world. Like the Rolls-Royce or the Zippo lighter, it has become part of mythology, an <b>icon that represents a standard of quality and versatility</b> which has carried through from the nineteenth into the twenty-first century.<br><br> The basic design of the knife has changed little since <b>Karl Elsener patented the first Swiss Officer&#x2019;s Knife in 1897</b>, but the context within which the knives are now used would have astonished him. Elsener&#x2019;s knives have been used at the top of Mount Everest and on coral reefs; astronauts carry them in the Space Shuttle; and they have saved lives on the ocean, in the air and in the desert.<br><br> Charles Elsener, the fourth son of a hat-maker, decided not to enter the family business but to become a cutler. After serving his apprenticeship in south Germany, he opened his own business near Schwyz in Switzerland. Soon after, in 1891, he formed the Swiss Cutlery Guild with the main aim of producing soldiers&#x2019; knives for the Swiss Army, which had to date been bought from German sources. By the end of the year, the first batch had been delivered and Elsener&#x2019;s plan proved a success&#x2014;<b>the first knife, known by name rather than type number&#x2014;the Soldier&#x2019;s knife&#x2014;had a blade, awl, can opener, and screwdriver</b>. Then the development started: as well as the simple Soldier&#x2019;s knife he quickly developed the Student Knife, the Cadet Knife and Farmer&#x2019;s Knife. Because the Soldier&#x2019;s knife was heavy, Elsener developed the lighter Officer&#x2019;s knife, with an added second blade and a corkscrew.<br><br> On 26 April 2005 Victorinox acquired Wenger, its historic rival and the other official supplier of the Swiss Army knife. It also started expanding its product range to include fragrances, travel gear, and watches. Victorinox has since licensed the Swiss Army brand and shield logo to companies producing watches, writing tools, luggage and&nbsp;clothing. Victorinox produces some 34,000 Swiss Army knives, 38,000 multi-tools, and 30,000 household, kitchen, and knives per workday. Approximately 90 percent of its production is exported to more than 100 countries.&nbsp; With a wide reach and diverse product development, it's no wonder their knives are so popular.</p><p><p>Engineer <b>Dr. Patrick Hook</b> worked in the motor-racing and automotive industry before gaining a PhD within the Exeter University Auxetic Materials Group.

It didn&#x2019;t matter how many times she waved it&#x2014;not a single spark of magic appeared.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;re doing it wrong?&#x201d; said her younger brother, Oliver, who was dangling upside down from the tree swing nearby. &#x201c;Have you tried saying abracadabra?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve tried <i>everything</i>, Ollie,&#x201d; Ava said. &#x201c;Nothing works.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ever since she was old enough to read fairy tales, Ava had been absolutely certain that magic was real. She&#x2019;d watched all the magicians&#x2019; tricks she could find on the Internet. She&#x2019;d studied how to track down fairies in the backyard. She&#x2019;d read all about mythical beasts like unicorns and dragons. But she <i>still</i> hadn&#x2019;t found any signs of actual, real magic, and Ava couldn&#x2019;t help but feel a little disappointed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Oliver flipped the right way up. &#x201c;Maybe you just haven&#x2019;t looked in the right place yet.&#x201d; He jumped off the swing and grabbed for the lowest branch of the tree. Quickly, he started to climb. &#x201c;How about up here?&#x201d; he suggested with a grin.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oliver!&#x201d; called Mom from behind the barbecue. &#x201c;Not too high!&#x201d; She flipped over a burger. &#x201c;Besides, lunch will be ready soon.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Dad poked his head out from the shed. He spotted Oliver and beamed at him. &#x201c;Great climbing, Ollie!&#x201d; he called. Then, on second thought: &#x201c;I mean, be careful, and everything!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ava smiled. Mom and Dad were what their aunt Sophie called &#x201c;eccentric.&#x201d; That meant they were a little strange, but in a cool sort of way. When Mom wasn&#x2019;t working in the city, and Dad wasn&#x2019;t fixing mountain bikes from home, they were always doing something new and exciting. Knowing Dad, he probably wanted to be up in the tree with Oliver.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; called Oliver. &#x201c;Look at me! I&#x2019;m so high up, I&#x2019;m almost in outer space!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oliver&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;,&#x201d; said Mom.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Joking!&#x201d; said Oliver. &#x201c;Ava, come on. It&#x2019;s great up here. I haven&#x2019;t found any magic for you yet, but everything is really small when you&#x2019;re this high up. You look <i>tiny</i>!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ava grinned and waved at her brother. She&#x2019;d leave the tree climbing to Oliver&#x2014;the swing was free now, so she could have her turn at last. Ava had a theory that if she swung high enough, she&#x2019;d know what flying would feel like.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Keep looking!&#x201d; she called. &#x201c;Magic hides in the most unlikely places. Or, at least, that&#x2019;s how it always works in books.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Soon Ava was swinging back and forth, her dark hair flying into her face and then streaming out behind her again. She wished that she could just wave a wand&#x2014;one that actually worked&#x2014;and it would make glittering silver wings appear on her back. Then she would soar up to join Oliver at the top of the tree, and they would fly up high into the clouds, where dragons and unicorns would&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;. would&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ava&#x2019;s daydream escaped her. She stared at the ground as it rose and fell beneath the swing, her mouth gaping.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>What was that?!</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Whoa,&#x201d; she breathed. She wasn&#x2019;t sure exactly what she&#x2019;d seen, but she knew that she had to investigate, and fast. She swung higher so that she was level with Oliver. &#x201c;Look!&#x201d; she called, pointing quickly with one hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> Oliver followed her gaze, and his eyes widened. &#x201c;Whoa!&#x201d; he exclaimed, echoing Ava.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come on!&#x201d; yelled Ava. She swung down, stuck out her feet, and skidded to a halt, clouds of dirt billowing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Oliver climbed down the tree a lot faster than he&#x2019;d gone up it, landing in a heap at the bottom within just a few seconds. He sprang to his feet, shaking leaves from his brown hair.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did you <i>see</i> that?&#x201d; gasped Ava.<br> &nbsp;<br> Oliver nodded fast. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> So they did. Except Ava sprinted to the left&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;. and Oliver ran to the right.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Typical Ollie</i>, Ava thought. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going the wrong way!&#x201d; she yelled over her shoulder, heading for the very spot she&#x2019;d noticed from high up on the swing.<br> &nbsp;<br> And there it was, nestled in a hollow at the magnolia tree&#x2019;s roots. It was white, and it was curved, and it was dotted with pink and teal speckles. Ava had never seen anything so beautiful. Or so <i>magical</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was an egg.<br> &nbsp;<br> She reached out and gently picked it up. The egg was smoother than silk and warm to the touch. What could possibly be inside it? An eagle? A dodo? A little dragon?<br> &nbsp;<br> She heard footsteps in the grass behind her. Ava spun around, moving to protect the egg, but it was just Oliver.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sis!&#x201d; he called, his face lighting up. &#x201c;What are you doing over here?&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t wait for an answer. &#x201c;You should have gone to the rose bed! Because guess what I found! Actually, you won&#x2019;t guess. It&#x2019;s too awesome. Should I just tell you? I think I will. It&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;An egg?&#x201d; said Ava. She was too excited to wait.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How did you know?&#x201d; demanded Oliver, showing her the egg he had hidden behind his back. It was exactly the same size and shape as Ava&#x2019;s, but had purple speckles instead.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Keep your voice down,&#x201d; whispered Ava. &#x201c;I guessed it was an egg because&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x201d; She moved so that he could see her egg. &#x201c;I found one, too!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where do you think they came from?&#x201d; Oliver breathed. He and Ava gently placed their eggs down side by side under the magnolia tree.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Somewhere magical,&#x201d; said Ava. And it wasn&#x2019;t just because she always thought things were magical, either. Something about these eggs felt&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;. different. <i>Special.</i> Like they were exactly what Ava had been waiting for.<br> &nbsp;<br> Oliver and Ava knelt down in front of the eggs and waited to see what they&#x2019;d do next.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is so unbelievably cool,&#x201d; said Oliver, grinning from ear to ear. &#x201c;Mystery eggs! In <i>our</i> backyard! Do you think we&#x2019;ll be on the news? But not one of the sad stories. I mean the part at the end, right before the weather, where they have a happy story to cheer everyone up. I&#x2019;d like to be on that part. Ava? Ava, are you even listening?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ava was staring at the egg, wondering dreamily when she&#x2019;d last been this excited. On their last family vacation, probably. Or maybe on her eighth birthday, when they&#x2019;d gone to the ice rink and then for ice cream. That had been really special, but it was <i>nowhere near</i> as amazing as this.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; she whispered gently to her egg, hoping that it would do something, like wiggle or wobble or crack just a little. But nothing happened. Her smile wavered, but she was convinced. These eggs <i>were</i> magical. She just knew it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; said Oliver, leaning closer to the mysterious egg. &#x201c;Come out, come out, whatever you are&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;,&#x201d; he murmured, leaning so close that his nose was almost touching his egg. Nothing. &#x201c;Pfft,&#x201d; he said, sitting back on his heels. &#x201c;Whatever&#x2019;s inside, it&#x2019;s boring!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Shhhhh!&#x201d; said Ava. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll hurt their feelings.&#x201d; Then she blinked. Was she imagining it or had she just seen two red eyes flash from inside Oliver&#x2019;s egg? She rubbed her eyes. The egg looked the same as it had before. Was she just seeing things?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; said Oliver sheepishly.<br> &nbsp;<br> A soft breeze blew, rustling the leaves of the magnolia tree and carrying Mom&#x2019;s words down the backyard. &#x201c;Ava! Oliver! Lunch is ready!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;d better go, Ollie,&#x201d; said Ava reluctantly. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be wondering where we are.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Just one more minute,&#x201d; said Oliver, tapping his egg gently with a finger.<br> &nbsp;<br> And that was when it happened.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tat-a-tat.<br> &nbsp;<br> Something inside the egg tapped back.</p><h2>Shark Vs Train</h2><p>rade Level: P and up Shark VS.

After the UN adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in 1948, Lemkin slipped into obscurity, and within a few short years many of the same governments that had agreed to outlaw genocide and draft a Universal Declaration of Human Rights tried to undermine these principles.</p><p>This intellectual biography of one of the twentieth century's most influential theorists and human rights figures sheds new light on the origins of the concept and word "genocide," contextualizing Lemkin's intellectual development in interwar Poland and exploring the evolving connection between his philosophical writings, juridical works, and politics over the following decades. The book presents Lemkin's childhood experience of anti-Jewish violence in imperial Russia; his youthful arguments to expand the laws of war to protect people from their own governments; his early scholarship on Soviet criminal law and nationalities violence; his work in the 1930s to advance a rights-based approach to international law; his efforts in the 1940s to outlaw genocide; and his forays in the 1950s into a social-scientific and historical study of genocide, which he left unfinished.</p><p>Revealing what the word "genocide" meant to people in the wake of World War II&#x2014;as the USSR and Western powers sought to undermine the Genocide Convention at the UN, while delegations from small states and former colonies became the strongest supporters of Lemkin's law&#x2014;<i>Rapha�l Lemkin and the Concept of Genocide</i> examines how the meaning of genocide changed over the decades and highlights the relevance of Lemkin's thought to our own time.</p></p><p>Douglas Irvin-Erickson is Assistant Professor and Director of the Genocide Prevention Program at The School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution, George Mason University.<p>Introduction</p><p>Rapha�l Lemkin coined the word "genocide" in the winter of 1942 and inspired a movement in the United Nations to outlaw the crime. Together with figures such as Ren� Cassin, John Humphrey, Hersch Lauterpacht, Jacob Robinson, Vespasian Pella, Henri Donnedieu de Vabres, and Eleanor Roosevelt, Lemkin set his sights on reimagining human rights institutions and humanitarian law after the Second World War. Lemkin described the UN Paris Assembly of 1948 as "the end of the golden age for humanitarian treaties at the U.N." After the UN adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in 1948, Lemkin slipped into obscurity. Within a few short years, many of the same governments that had agreed to outlaw genocide and draft a Universal Declaration of Human Rights tried to undermine these principles.</p><p>By the last years of his life, Lemkin was living in poverty in a New York apartment. When he died of heart failure in 1959, it had been two years since he last taught at Rutgers University and his life work seemed for naught. The United States, Lemkin's adopted country, did not ratify the Genocide Convention during his lifetime. If they were familiar with the word "genocide" at all, leaders in governments around the world either thought genocide was inevitable or believed states had a right to commit genocide against people within their borders. In the context of the Cold War, during which real and existential danger lurked in the specter of nuclear annihilation and the struggle between capitalism and communism, genocide was seen as grave but not a threat to world peace. Except for a few scholars who took Lemkin seriously, decades passed before his accomplishments were recognized.</p><p>In the 1960s, movements within Armenian and Jewish diasporas began to look to Lemkin's writing on Armenian and Jewish genocides to qualify the cases as international crimes. Lemkin would not be widely known until the 1990s, when international prosecutions of genocide began in response to atrocities in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. In 1998, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda became the first international court to convict a defendant, Jean-Paul Akayesu, of genocide. These tribunals positioned Lemkin's ideas at the center of international law and sparked an effort to reexamine the life and works of the jurists and thinkers who created those laws and institutions after the Second World War. In the late 1990s, the word "genocide" began to be used as a type of moral category, taking on a symbolic quality as the crime of crimes, the darkest of humanity's inhumanity.</p><p>Cassin, who along with Humphrey is considered the main author of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is now regarded as one of the century's most influential figures. The study of Lauterpacht, the jurist who gave crimes against humanity its juridical form and helped create an international legal regime based on individual rights and responsibilities, has also enjoyed a renaissance. Scholars in the 1990s began to realize that Lauterpacht had sparked a movement to revise the Grotian and Victorian traditions in international law, moving the law away from Hugo Grotius's model of viewing international relations as the relations between states and toward an understanding that international politics was shaped by individuals and social and political movements within states. For Lauterpacht, both states and individuals could be the subject of international law. Lauterpacht, nevertheless, upheld Grotius's vision that it was always in one's self-interest to act morally and that the object of international law should point toward a law of love and charity.</p><p>Lemkin, this book argues, shared Lauterpacht's views, believing that individuals and social movements within states drove international politics between states and that individuals should, therefore, be the subjects of international law. There were important differences between the two jurists, and Lauterpacht rejected the notion that his ideas were similar to Lemkin's. Lauterpacht&#x2014;who proposed that the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal use the term "crimes against humanity" to describe the killing of four million Jews and Poles in occupied Poland&#x2014;intended to use the concept of crimes against humanity to criminalize the act of killing individuals as part of a systematic plan, introducing protections for individuals into international law for the first time. Lemkin, by contrast, intended genocide to signify the destruction of national groups, to inscribe protections for national-cultural autonomy into international law.</p><p>Lauterpacht believed that crimes against humanity introduced an individual rights-based approach to international law, and that the concept of genocide did not follow in this tradition because it did not explicitly protect individuals. Although Lemkin is often described as a group rights thinker, he considered genocide to be a crime against humanity, and he thought he was articulating an individual rights-based argument to justify preventing genocide. The goal of outlawing genocide, Lemkin argued, was not to make the right of groups to exist inviolate but to prohibit people from attempting to destroy entire ways of life and ethnic traditions, which caused real suffering for individuals. These atrocities, he argued, assaulted the very foundation of the entire human rights project: a respect for the right of individuals to practice their own traditions and express their own subjectivity. In such a way, Lemkin saw a law against genocide as embodying cosmopolitan sensibilities and safeguarding a world in which human rights could be possible. Lauterpacht and Lemkin, therefore, should be understood as working in tandem to advance a rights-based approach to international law, conceptualizing the two crimes that now rest at the foundation of the global international legal regime: crimes against humanity and genocide.</p><p>Rapha�l Lemkin in Lemkin Studies</p><p>Intellectual biographies are inevitably built around a "double gaze" that looks back in time "in the direction of the practical field" of what the subject accomplished and did and forward "in the direction of the ethical field" to establish the importance of the subject's life and thought. Recognizing these limitations, this book is not intended to be a definitive biography of Lemkin. Instead, it aims to be a work of political theory and political history, sitting at the crossroads of the philosophy and history of international relations and international law, while providing an account of Lemkin's thought that connects the history of ideas to the social and political contexts of his milieu.</p><p>Until 2007, only two books had been written about Lemkin. One, by William Korey, is still, in many ways, a standard text in the field. The second was authored by a Holocaust denier who accused Lemkin of spinning anti-Nazi propaganda. Lemkin would become known to the wider public in 2002, when Samantha Power included a short biographical sketch of him in her Pulitzer Prize-winning book, <i>"A Problem from Hell": America and the Age of Genocide</i>. Even though Power's book positioned Lemkin as a human rights hero, the book did not elucidate Lemkin's thinking, focusing instead on Lemkin within the context of US foreign policy.</p><p>John Cooper's biography did, at first, work to establish a chronology of Lemkin's life and work. Cooper's book, however, collapses Lemkin's political theory into his biography and comes to the conclusion that it was Lemkin's experience of the Holocaust that led to his formulation of the idea of genocide in late 1942. Cooper argues that the conception of genocide could never have emerged in previous historical moments because the occurrence of the Holocaust marked a new epoch in human history when it was now possible to contemplate an intentional and state-organized effort to exterminate an entire people. Finally, Cooper rejects Lemkin's self-characterization as a cosmopolitan, writing that Lemkin used his autobiographical writings "to present himself as a universal man, an interpretation which has been followed by most historians. His roots, however, were in the quagmire of ethnic conflict in pre-War Eastern Europe and were authentically Jewish."</p><p>I argue that Lemkin's thinking cannot be reduced to his experiences of any particular historical event or ethnicity. Within genocide studies, this claim is controversial. The Holocaust, the Armenian Genocide, the Ukrainian Great Famine, and European settler colonialism have all been offered up as the cases Lemkin intended the word "genocide" to signify. As Henry Theriault has argued, the claim that Lemkin "invented" the idea of genocide in reference to a specific historical case has allowed scholars to appeal "to Lemkin's authority" to claim "this or that is what he <i>really</i> meant by the concept of genocide." A more critical bibliography of Lemkin studies has developed through academic journal articles, book chapters, chapters in edited volumes, and editor's introductions to recently published volumes of Lemkin's writings. These scholars have used Lemkin to revitalize the study of genocide in the social sciences as a type of conflict, not a type of violence. Historians have turned to Lemkin to develop inclusive methodologies for studying genocide. Legal scholars have begun to use Lemkin's works to explore the importance of words and language in shaping the law and to ask whether reducing the reality of genocide to a fixed legal category undermines the moral progress that labeling an act "genocide" is supposed to achieve.</p><p>In trying to sort out the intellectual history behind Lemkin's thinking on genocide, this book will inevitably fall prone to the "rhetorical illusions" inherent in any intellectual biography, in which the subject is contrived so as to give his or her life and mind a logical coherence, when his or her actual life and thought could never have been reduced to any such logic. I can only hope that my attempt to place Lemkin's works within their historical and intellectual contexts can mitigate these rhetorical illusions. I also hope this contextualization can show that the idea of genocide was neither immanent in history&#x2014;as if genocide were a natural phenomenon that Lemkin happened to name&#x2014;nor immanent in the writings of various thinkers in his milieu, as if others had identified the concept before him but failed to name it.</p><p>The first two chapters present an overview of Lemkin's childhood, university education, and his early Polish-language works from the late 1920s and early 1930s on the penal codes of Poland, the Soviet Union, and Fascist Italy. Chapter 2 concludes with an analysis of Lemkin's foray into the field of international law and his 1933 proposal to outlaw acts he called "barbarity" and "vandalism" at the League of Nations. These proposed crimes, which were rejected by his colleagues, were the conceptual precursors to Lemkin's formulation of genocide. The chapter also discusses important developments in Lemkin's intellectual milieu, delving into the thought of his university professors.</p><p>Especially important was Lemkin's turn to the political theory of Austro-Hungarian Marxists Otto Bauer and Karl Renner, which helps resolve a controversy that has consumed Lemkin studies: whether Lemkin was a group rights or individual rights thinker. As Mark Lewis has argued, the tendency for scholars to reduce the developments in international law after the First World War to a competition between liberal cosmopolitans and romantic nationalists is wholly inadequate. This dichotomy is too limited to explain the intellectual milieu, and it assumes the proponents of each camp had the same intentions or wanted to solve the same problems. Within Lemkin scholarship, the argument over whether Lemkin was a liberal or a romantic nationalist fails to explain his thought. Lemkin rose to prominence during the interwar years as part of what Lewis has termed the "new justice" movement. But Lemkin's unique interpretation of this "new justice" was shaped by Bauer's and Renner's political theory&#x2014;especially Renner's liberal defense of protecting national-cultural autonomy. In such a way, I argue, the debate over whether Lemkin was a liberal individualist or a communitarian also fails to explain his thought.</p><p>The ideas of Renner and Bauer were taken up by many in the Jewish socialist movement in Eastern Europe who sought to achieve a form of emancipation that would enable Jews to be incorporated into general society and enjoy equality without losing their independent national identity. This challenge gained a special relevance for Jews living in Eastern Europe where political movements expressed a commitment to the idea of the <i>Volksstaat</i>, a people's state, that was first articulated by Romantic thinkers such as Johann Gottfried Herder and Johann Gottlieb Fichte. These Romantic thinkers transformed national identity into a civic religion, considered self-fulfillment a criterion of individual freedom, and championed a homogeneous state where customs and convictions became the vehicle for achieving self-fulfillment and citizenship. Chapter 2 demonstrates that Lemkin rejected Herder and Fichte and the political movements their philosophies inspired. When Lemkin told the <i>Christian Century</i> in a 1956 interview that he did not consider himself to be only Polish or Jewish because he did "not belong exclusively to one race or one religion," he was rejecting this organic nationalist worldview without completely giving up his communitarian sentiments.</p><p>Seeking a form of equality that allowed for difference, Lemkin was representative of a common Jewish experience in his milieu, which "straddles the interstices of universal identifications and particular attachments." The national cultural autonomy movement&#x2014;shaped by thinkers such as Bauer, Renner, and the Jewish historian Simon Dubnow, whom Lemkin greatly admired&#x2014;did not see individuals as expressions of a single trans-historical nation. The national cultural autonomy theorists and Jewish socialists often spoke in idioms of "nations" and "cultures" having their own "spirits," but they did not believe these "spirits" had a fixed form that existed prior to society, trans-historically. They were also trying to offer individuals two things that the Romantic nationalists opposed: freedom from the arbitrary interference in their lives because of their subjective identities that included the right to freely practice one's ethno-cultural traditions; and equality under the law as individuals, not group rights. As Chapter 7 explains, it was intellectuals like Heinrich von Treitschke, Lemkin wrote, whose arguments that Jews were a drain on the German nation followed in the wake of Herder and Fichte and created the early foundations for Nazism.</p><p>Chapters 3 and 4 cover the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany and present the first sustained scholarly reading of Lemkin's magnum opus, <i>Axis Rule in Occupied Europe</i>, the book in which the word "genocide" first appears in print Chapter 3 argues that the typology of genocide Lemkin developed in <i>Axis Rule</i> was not intended to be a typology of all genocides, but rather the specific genocide as it was being committed in Axis-occupied Europe, especially in Poland. Lemkin was not trying to coin the word "genocide" ...</p></p><h2>Christopher Nejman&#39;s Pillows: Designer Sewing Techniques</h2><p><p><b>No other book on the market demonstrates how to create designer pillows!</b></p><p>Affordable elegance - many quality sewing machines cost $200 or less and can easily be used to create vibrant high-style items</p><p>This exquisite sewing guide helps you gain confidence in your own creativity, and truly believe your favorite sewing machine has unlimited potential.

His life, however, has always been shrouded in mystery. Now an eminent Shakespearean scholar presents a complete picture of his life and times and reveals the man himself. <br><br>In this extraordinary study, Professor Hildegard Hammerschmidt-Hummel sets the great English playwright firmly in his time and reveals his deep involvement in the dramatic political events of the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. After ascending the throne, Queen Elizabeth I made Anglicanism, a version of the Protestant confession, the official State religion and announced her aim to abolish Catholicism within her lifetime. Brutal persecution of priests and believers in the Old Religion followed and they were forced to go underground or into exile. This background of religious ferment meant that, due to their potentially explosive content, nearly half of Shakespeare&#x2019;s works could not be published during his lifetime, only becoming public seven years after his death. Hammerschmidt-Hummel demonstrates how this political backdrop is the key to understanding so many of the secrets and puzzles of Shakespeare&#x2019;s life and work. Who were Shakespeare&#x2019;s friends and enemies? What did he do during his &#x2018;lost years&#x2019;? How did he manage to become the most influential writer in England in such a short time? What did his contemporaries think and write about him? Why did he suddenly start writing tragedies? Is Hamlet, the tragedy of a great Prince in a rotten State, a reflection of the dramatic and tragic events at the end of the Elizabethan age? And why did Shakespeare fail to write one word of homage to the Queen during her 45-year reign? Professor Hildegard Hammerschmidt-Hummel answers these and other key questions in this comprehensive and groundbreaking biography of William Shakespeare.</p><p>Professor Hildegard Hammerschmidt-Hummel teaches English Literature and Culture at the University of Mainz. Her many publications include the seminal three volume study Shakespearian Illustrations 1594-2000, The Secret Surrounding Shakespeare&#x2019;s Dark Lady, and The Secret Life of William Shakespeare. Her major biography, The Life and Times of William Shakespeare, will be published by Chaucer Press in April 2007.</p><h2>Flora of Florida, Volume III: Dicotyledons, Vitaceae through Urticaceae</h2><p>Praise for <i>Flora of Florida, Volume I</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;An invaluable source. . . .

A Killer Life is a book about just that: the killer life of an alternative film producer who&#39;s forged her own path of success between the disparate pillars of art and commerce. Strong, steady, creative, loyal, funny, artistic, and doggedly determined to produce films that have meaning and substance and staying power in the pantheon of great cinema, Christine Vachon, a member of the Academy and born and bred on the realistic, unforgiving streets of New York City, is one of the most important people working behind the scenes in the film industry today. How did she get there? Why do directors love her? What does it take to produce great movies? What happened on the set of Kids ? These answers and more are in her book!</p><p>Interested in the travails of big-time creative movie producers? Check out Vachon's entertainingly brooding story, that of a producer of such edgy yet profitable films as <i>Boys Don't Cry</i> and <i>Far from Heaven</i>. More than the grandiose Robert Evans (<i>Urban Cowboy</i>, <i>Chinatown--</i>but also <i>The Cotton Club</i>), who memorably chronicled his career in autobio <i>The Kid Stays in the Picture</i> (1994), Vachon tightrope-walks between making engaging movies and turning a profit, which nowadays means earning enough to ensure further opportunities to film stories different from the current mainstream fare of feelings-heavy weepers and gratuitous-explosion capers. Despite Vachon's proven track record, bottom-line considerations are never far from her consciousness, and the ingenious ways in which she deals with that situation provide much fodder for ironic reflection and pointed exposition. Her tale of professional ups and downs engagingly describes the Hollywood firmament that lies between the heady realm of big-timers like Evans and the hand-to-mouth existence of ground-level filmmakers like Lloyd Kaufman of <i>Toxic Avenger</i> fame. A fine, informative, entertaining addition to -inside-Hollywood literature. <i>Mike Tribby</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>The day-to-day life of independent film production is not the stuff of charming anecdotes on DVD commentaries. Instead, as Vachon skillfully explicates, it is a constant and difficult struggle between the competing influences of artistic vision and the always present bottom line. As the head of Killer Films, which has produced such alternative hits as <i>Boys Don't Cry</i> and <i>Far from Heaven</i>, Vachon is in a difficult position: she is an insider whose job is to constantly support outsider stories. The financial reality of the world she chronicles provides the drama that sustains this empathetic and thoroughly engaging memoir. Vachon's voice is likable and slightly neurotic, allowing the reader to develop a rooting interest in her continual quest to secure financing for often controversial films. Though Vachon's account is slightly hampered by her obvious bias toward her own films, the book teems with the veracity that can only come from hard-earned experience. This is an immensely appealing view into the expensive reality of imaginative filmmaking. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Read it open-mouthed; wonder and shudder.&#34; - &#34;Independent&#34;. This is the story of the largest corporate take-over in American history. With a stake of $25 billion, the battle for the control of RJR Nabisco during October and November 1988 became a symbol of the greed and power-mongering of the eighties. This gripping narrative reveals the truth behind a Wall Street gamble that sent shock waves through the international business world. The rules were simple: never pay in cash - never tell the truth - never play by the rules. &#34;All the suspense of a first-rate thriller - one of the finest, most compelling accounts of what happened to corporate America and Wall Street in the 1980s.&#34; - &#34;New York Times Book Review&#34;. For their coverage of the RJR Nabisco take-over, Burrough and Helyar received the prestigious Gerald Loeb Award for Distinguished Business and Financial Journalism.</p><p><p>Over six months on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list, <em>Barbarians at the Gate</em> is <em>the</em> definitive account of the largest takeover in Wall Street history. Bryan Burrough and John Helyar's gripping record of the frenzy that overtook Wall Street in October and November of 1988 is the story of deal makers and pulicity flaks, of strategy meetings and society dinners, of boardrooms and bedrooms, giving us not only an unprecedentedly detailed look at how financial operations at the highest levels are conducted but also a richly textured social history of wealth at the twilight of the Reagan era. As compelling as a novel, <em>Barbarians at the Gate</em> is must reading for everyone interested in the way today's world <em>really</em> works.</p>Bryan Burrough is a reporter for the Wall Street Journal in New York.

The Theosophical Society, founded in 1875 by Helena P. Blavatsky, holds a crucial position as the place where all these currents temporarily united, before again diverging. The book&#x2019;s ambiguous title points to the author&#x2019;s thesis that Theosophy owed as much to the skeptical Enlightenment of the eighteenth century as it did to the concept of spiritual enlightenment with which it is more readily associated.<br><br>The author respects his sources sufficiently to allow that their world, so different from that of academic reductionism, has a right to be exhibited on its own terms. At the same time he does not conceal the fact that he considers many of them deluded and deluding.<br><br>In the context of theosophical history, this book is neither on the side of the blind votaries of Madame Blavatsky, nor on that of her enemies. It may, therefore, be expected to mildly annoy both sides.</p><p><p>Joscelyn Godwin is a Professor at Colgate University.

He gives details of his encounters over a ten-year period with such figures as Hugh Trevor Roper, Alan Bullock, Claude Lanzmann and Emile Fackenheim. He reveals both new and forgotten material which help explain one of history&#39;s greatest enigmas.</p><p>Debates concerning the historical and moral significance of Adolf Hitler have gone on since the beginning of his rise to power in Germany. In the decades after his bunker suicide, those debates elevated to arguments over the very nature and existence of evil. An integral part of the arguments has been the ongoing attempt to understand the <i>why</i> of Hitler. In this engaging work of literary journalism, Ron Rosenbaum travels the world to converse with some of the historians, philosophers, filmmakers, and others who have attempted to make sense of Hitler's actions, to find a root cause for the Holocaust.<p> Rosenbaum methodically examines the evidence for and against all the major hypotheses concerning the origin of Hitler's character. He sifts through all the rumors--including his alleged Jewish ancestry and what biographer Alan Bullock refers to as "the one-ball business"--and the attempts to derive some psychological cause from them. Various Hitlers emerge: Hitler as con man and brutal gangster, Hitler the unspeakable pervert, Hitler the ladies' man, Hitler as modernist artist working in the medium of evil....</p><p> But Rosenbaum's portrayals of those who would define Hitler are as fascinating as the shifting perspectives on the f�hrer. Here we see the brave journalists of the <i>Munich Post</i> who attempted to reveal Hitler's evil to the world as early as the 1920s. We witness <i>Shoah</i> director Claude Lanzmann's imperious attempts to stifle analysis of Hitler and the Holocaust, branding such historical inquiries as "obscene." We see the effects, on a frazzled Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, of the controversy surrounding the publication of his <i>Hitler's Willing Executioners</i>. We see the interior crises of Hitler apologist David Irving and philosopher-novelist George Steiner, among others, as they struggle with the ramifications of their work and thought. And, best of all, we have Rosenbaum to serve as an informed, intimate, and on occasion witty guide. In <i>White Noise</i>, Don DeLillo depicted the satirical academic discipline of "Hitler studies;" Ron Rosenbaum breathes a life into the field that no fiction can match. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p><p>Ron Rosenbaum grew up on Long Island, New York. A graduate of Yale with a degree in English literature, he left Yale Graduate School to write full-time. His essays and journalism have appeared in <em>Harper's, Esquire, The New Republic, Vanity Fair,</em> and <em>The New Yorker; </em>he's done eight cover stories for the <em>New York Times Magazine.</em> He is the author of four previous books, including one novel and three collections of his essays and journalism, most recently <em>Travels with Dr Death and Other Unusual Investigations.</em> </p><p>The Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and historian Thomas Powers called him "one of the few distinctive voices of modern American literary journalism." His work has been characterized by the essayist Phillip Lopate as combining "the skills of a terrific investigative reporter and an accomplished literary stylist with an idiosyncratic streak all his own." </p><p>More than ten years ago, he began investigating certain unresolved controversies among Hitler biographers, and ultimately embarked on an odyssey that took him from Vienna and Munich to London, Paris, and Jerusalem. The book that emerged combines original research and dramatic face-to-face encounters with historians, philosophers, psychologists, and theologians as they attempt to account for the elusive figure of Adolf Hitler and the meanings projected upon him by his explainers. </p><p>Currently Ron Rosenbaum writes for the <em>New York Times Magazine,</em> and <em>The New York Observer, </em>and teaches a course on literary journalism at the Columbia Graduate School of journalism. </p></p><h2>Exodusters: Black migration to Kansas after Reconstruction</h2><p><p><strong>The first major migration to the North of ex-slaves.</strong></p></p><p>&#39;In 1879, fourteen years after the Emancipation Proclamation, thousands of blacks fled the South.

When tragedy strikes, the results are too violent and tragic for even Lois to bear...</p><p>Ann Purser lives in England.Lois Meade, owner of New Brooms cleaning service in the English village of Long Farnden, needs more staff, thanks to the unexpected success of her business. So, when quiet, well-spoken Enid Abraham applies, Lois is delighted. Unfortunately, despite her excellent cleaning skills, Enid has a dark family history. She shares her home--gloomy Carthanger Mill--with her reclusive mother and hard-bitten father, but it's her ne'er-do-well brother, Edward, who is the real thorn in the family's side. The Abrahams are universally disliked by the villagers, and New Brooms begins to suffer when Lois hires Enid.

The Becher's serenely cool, disarmingly objective, and notoriously obsessive images of watertowers, gas tanks, grain elevators, blast furnaces, and mine heads have been taken over a period of almost thirty years, under overcast skies, with a view camera that captures each detail and tonality of wood, concrete, brick, and steel.<br> <br> <i>Blast Furnaces </i>represents a continuation of, but also a counterpoint to the Bechers' earlier book <i>Watertowers. </i>There basic functional elements were hidden or clothed in disguises, whereas the 256 duotone prints included here record a purely functional and exposed architecture, built to contain heat, pressure, and accumulations of gases and unhindered by any outside constraints.<br> <br> The blast furnace is the symbol of the steel industry. Like other building types which attract the Bechers, it is also an endangered industrial species. Essentially giant, cone-shaped circular stoves, blast furnaces dominate the cityscapes of Pittsburgh, Youngstown, and Birmingham much as religious structures dominated medieval cities. These photographs, taken between 1961 and 1989, convey the unique characteristics, physical complexity, and eerie presence in the landscape of blast furnaces in Great Britain, Belgium, France, Austria, Germany, and the United States.<br> <br> Bernd and Hilla Becher teach at the D�sseldorf Art Academy. They began their collaborative photographic enterprise in 1957, when they did a study of workers' houses in their native Germany. The Bechers follow in a distinguished line of German photographers that includes August Sander, Albert Renger-Patzsch, and Werner Manz, all of whom contributed in different ways to the definition of "objective" photography. A selection of their photographs is on view throughout 1990 at the Dia Art Foundation galleries in New York, and they will represent Germany in the 1990 Venice Biennale.</p><p>Bernd and Hilla Becher have collaborated since 1959.

The only cookbook devoted to smoke-cooked barbecue, a hot trend.</p><p>Barbecue is not about grilling food fast over high heat. That's something else, delicious in its own right, but something else entirely. Barbecue is about marginal cuts of meat (for the most part), about smoke, about fires burning so low and slow you hardly ever see the flicker of a flame. Barbecue is about succulent pork ribs as dark as sin just falling off the bone and dripping with glorious sweet pork godliness. Or enjoying the effects that 12 to 18 hours of smoking has on beef brisket.<p> The trick is, how do you do it? How do you master a cooking technique all but ignored in favor of fast and hot? The answer lies in <i>Smoke &amp; Spice</i>. Authors Jamison and Jamison provide all the information you're ever going to need to run a <i>real</i> barbecue. Tips and techniques abound on every page--accompanied with countless recipes that stretch the barbecue imagination. And seeing that one cannot live on barbecue alone (though that's a challenge well worth considering) there are just as many recipes included for all the good food that accompanies barbecue--from Scalloped Green Chile Potatoes to South-of-the-Border Garlic Soup to Buttermilk Onion Rings and even Bourbon Peaches.

Andrew Roberts, Wolfson History prizewinner and superb narrative historian, has been inspired by Churchill&#39;s example to write the story of the 20th century. In his preface Churchill wrote: &#39;Every nation or group of nations has its own tale to tell. Knowledge of the trials and struggles is necessary to all who would comprehend the problems, perils, challenges, and opportunities which confront us today ...It is in the hope that contemplation of the trials and tribulations of our forefathers may not only fortify the English-speaking peoples of today, but also play some small part in uniting the whole world, that I present this account.&#39; As the greatest of all the trials and tribulations of the English-speaking peoples took place in the twentieth century, Roberts&#39; book covers the four world-historical struggles in which the English-speaking peoples have been engaged - the wars against German Nationalism, Axis Fascism, Soviet Communism and now the War against Terror. But just as Churchill did in his four volumes, Roberts also deals with the cultural, social and political history of the English global diaspora - comprising the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and the West Indies. Keeping to Churchill&#39;s definition it does not cover India, where there are 180 languages of which English is only that of the elite. But India&#39;s story overlaps with that of Britain and is fully dealt with in that context.</p><p>Andrew Roberts took a first in Modern History at Cambridge.

When summoned, they doctored the stricken, be they stoic elders or frightened little children. They conjured rains. Taking leave of reality, they rode whirlwinds and soared in magical flight. They epitomized a native American ability to relate to the land in ways beyond a Western way of thinking. They&#39;re gone now. But there remain telling accounts of how, day-to-day, they lived: how omens foretold a shaman&#39;s destiny, how he learned his craft, how he could exercise his power for both good and evil. How a shaman could travel to the land of the dead and (hopefully) return. Drawing on the lore of a dozen tribes, Old Magic conjures the year-to-year life of a shaman - a life of service to his people, a life fraught with torment and danger, a life often taking a man or woman to the edge of madness.</p><p>Documentary filmmaker and author Nicholas Clapp has explored, filmed, and written about the deserts of the world. He has won over seventy major awards for his documentary work. As an author, his distinguished previous publications include: The Road to Ubar: Finding the Atlantis of the Sands, Sheba: Through the Desert in Search of the Legendary Queen, Who Killed Chester Pray?: A Death Valley Mystery, Gold &amp; Silver in the Mojave: Images of a Last Frontier. His latest book, Old Magic: Lives of the Desert Shamans, fulfills a lifetime interest in archaeology and anthropology. He lived with the Zapotecs of southern Mexico (which earned him a Brown University scholarship), participated in the excavation of the Great Temple of Petra in Jordan, and was leader of a team that discovered the lost city of Ubar in the Sultanate of Oman.Old Magic: Lives of the Desert Shamans belongs in social science and Native American collections alike, examining the lives of the desert shamans of the West and providing important keys to understanding their daily experiences, perspectives and rituals. Old Magic is no singular production: it uses the folklore of a dozen tribes as it builds a diverse picture of the shaman's world, from dream-scape and tribal interactions to desert and mountain landscapes and their influence upon the overall approach of desert shaman ceremonies. Color photos of these landscapes, along with photos of relics and early recorded shaman imagery, pair with discussions that blend history and folklore with an analysis of the spiritual belief systems of the shaman. It would have been all too easy to tailor Old Magic to reach new age audiences alone, but Clapp's focus on documenting the desert shaman's unique approach to nature and human concerns, and the role his environment played in his perspectives, makes for a lively history that will also reach general-interest readers with an interest in Native American culture. --Midwest Book Review - California Bookwatch midwestbookreview.com/calbw/jul_15.htm#IndependentPublishers<br><br>Old Magic - Lives of The Desert Shamans, is a well researched, well written social science, anthropological and historical book. It tells the story of the lives of the desert Shamans, their culture, their beliefs in the spirits, their customs, their traditions, and how Shamans exercised their powers for both good and evil. After reading this book I came away with the understanding that the Shamans were a complex group of Native Americans who stuck to their customs, who loved painting on rocks, and showcasing their arts wherever it can be etched. The book is fraught with pictures of various types of rock art, or petroglyphs (rock etchings) it also has geoglyph or rock-scrape. Mr. Clapp is very descriptive when he writes about certain customs of the Shamans. For example, in explaining the ritual of boy's initiation, he is quite detailed, and well researched. He writes, ..."the boys were confined and prepared for the initiation, they knelt before a mortar and drank the portion of the kikisulem - the dry root was powerful, potent and fast acting, the initiates staggered one by one and crumpled to the ground, foamed at the mouth, might murmur or shriek as animals which was a good sign because an animal spirit helper was mighty. The author continues by stating that the boys will sink into a stupor, it was believed, in which they would glimpse what the future had for them and they will become men." Wow! what a vivid description; one can actually visualize certain aspects of the initiation. This form of ritual may seem harsh to some, however, this was the norm, which was quite acceptable and welcoming in the Desert Cahuilla ceremonials. This book is a valuable source of reference material for Social Science as well as Native American Studies. Nicholas Clapp gives his readers a very detailed and comprehensive study of the lives of the Desert Shamans. He did so in a sequential and factual manner. I thought the visuals of rock art, the mountains, deserts, sunsets etc. were quite appealing, and the photography was both awesome and superb. I enjoyed reading Old Magic - Lives of The Desert Shamans. It's a book that should be in every school's library, and should be required reading for high school Social Studies students. The Lives of The Desert Shamans is a history lesson that needs to be told and we all need to hear it. --East County Magazine - Jacqueline Carr 2/18/2015 DO YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC? eastcountymagazine.org/print/17761 2/3</p><h2>Goblin market</h2><p>Her sister&#39;s love saves Laura from the poison of the fruit she bought from the goblins in the haunted glen.</p><p>Christina Georgina Rossetti was part of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, along with her brothers Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William M.

Browsable reads to whet the appetite. The "editors" (authors) of these two volumes have hit upon a unifying theme to chronicle the accomplishments of the ancients?a newspaper style. The Roman News and The Greek News are not exactly major city dailies; their format is more suggestive of a news magazine or at least a Sunday section highlighting fashion, sports, trade, food, and the military. Each page presents readable articles complete with headlines, boldface, column breaks, illustrations, and, often classifieds: instruments for sale; racing chariots built to order; reusable wax tablets. The front page (book cover) suggests a scope of approximately 1200 years, and the rise and fall of each empire is explained. A publisher's disclaimer also cautions that the ancients did not have newspapers (of course, they didn't even have paper!), but if they had, "they would have been reading...." Similar comments dart in and out of the news stories so that the entire tone is more human interest than ready reference. Such editorializing, however, only slightly distracts from the facts, which are accurate. Significant dates and events are all newsworthy. "Olympic Games Spoiled," "Caesar Stabbed," and "Hannibal Invades" are typical stories. The slightly oversized pages with decorative borders, sidebars, ads, and cartoons create an interesting layout. Many teachers would probably rejoice with the delivery of The Greek or Roman News as a project for a social-studies or whole-language unit. Kids can adopt this highly readable, albeit slightly sensationalized journalistic style.

No spiritual path, leader, or personal or political philosophy will guide us in this endeavor, he said; this transformation of the human psyche is a truth that each of us must discover within. <br><br>Here, Krishnamurti teaches that the war and destruction human beings wreak on each other and the environment are caused by our misplaced attachment to a sense of self and individuality that leads to aggression, competition, greed, and conflict. When we recognize that our consciousness is not individual but common to all humans, we can work together in a spirit of cooperation and compassion. Krishnamurti shows that taking personal responsibility for our actions and reactions&#x2014;in our relationships and in our lives&#x2014;is the necessary first step toward a global view.</p><p>Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895&#x2013;1986) was one of the most influential spiritual teachers of the twentieth century.

Something&#x2014;besides the fact that the gulf had gone rough since she'd begun her dive&#x2014;was terribly wrong.<br><br>She struggled to keep her underwater camera and strobe from being ripped away by the waves. Her tethered plastic slate with its latex rubber pencil she used to make notes underwater smacked her face; she thrust it behind her.<br><br>She kept the regulator in her mouth, clenched between her teeth. Still sucking in the air from her tank, she heard the hiss of her more rapid breathing mingled with the howl of the increasing wind. Since she was fairly low on air, her single tank yanked back and forth on her BC, the vest-style buoyancy compensator that supported her in the water.<br><br>This was impossible!

But Daria would never have left her out here.<br><br>Despite being a veteran diver, panic pulsed through Briana for herself and her sister. Bree and Daria Devon were not only twin sisters but had been best friends since they could remember.<br><br>Bree put more air in her BC to keep afloat and fought to calm herself. After all, she'd been diving for twenty of her twenty-eight years and swimming these waters even longer. Every week, she and Daria dived the artificial reef made by the wreck of an old trading boat to check on the growth of pollutant-endangered sea grass and marine life. The grass was a bellwether for the health of the gulf waters in general. It had all been routine until now.<br><br>Bree had not noticed whether the anchor had been pulled up. She'd only been intent on doing her work well and quickly. Just take the photos, make the notes, get proof. The results were bad news that was going to upset a lot of powerful people. She'd only come up early because visibility was lessening, and that meant the waves were kicking up. But she'd never imagined this churning, gray sea and gathering storm.<br><br>The twins had always buddy-dived unless they were just scraping barnacles off hulls at the marina, but there were two reasons Daria hadn't made the dive with her today. She'd suddenly developed a bad toothache, which would have made the underwater pressure excruciating for her. And someone had to stay with their dive boat: Daria had given Manny, their only employee at their search-and-salvage shop, the afternoon off since he'd been having so much trouble with his daughter. Actually, Daria hadn't been diving much this past month anyway, since she'd been so busy concentrating on her accounting class.<br><br>Bree's arms ached from trying to hang on to her camera and strobe in the increasing turbulence. She had never feared this vast stretch of water, only respected it, but now terror immobilized her. Alone. Abandoned? She should probably start swimming in, but she was over four miles out and she'd have to ditch her precious gear. She should have taken it as a bad sign when she saw that bull shark cruising past the reef instead of the usual resident grouper. Bulls became disturbed whenever the water was riled, and they were known to attack humans. How many times had she warned someone not to swim alone or far from shore, and to avoid splashing?<br><br>Bree had a whistle to summon help, but there was no one in range to hear it. She could set off her strobe to try to attract attention, but holding it above the waves would wear her out. Reluctantly she let her strobe lights and camera drop, hoping they would snag somewhere near the wreck and she&#x2014;they&#x2014;could retrieve them later. The camera was worth big bucks; they'd scraped a lot of barnacles off yachts to buy it.<br><br>The twins' co-owned marine search-and-salvage shop had been struggling, but things were on the upswing lately. They did everything from underwater surveys to hull maintenance to retrieval of lost items or sunken vessels. It could be dirty, hard, even dangerous work, but they both loved it. They knew what was below the surface of the gulf off southwest Florida almost as well as they knew each other.<br><br>It had been a surprise and a thrill when the prestigious Clear the Gulf Commission had hired them&#x2014;not their larger rival across the bay&#x2014;to record the difficult comeback of off-the-coast marine life under siege from toxic runoff. The whole local ecosystem was being poisoned by fertilizers from sugarcane fields, golf course fairways, and polluted water releases from just too many people.<br><br>To save her strength, Bree decided to dive again and get as far as she could underwater before she'd have to ditch her tanks and weight belt to swim in. Though she saw no watercraft, perhaps one would be heading for safe harbor and she could hail it. She upended and kicked down until the turbulence seemed to lessen.<br><br>The Gulf of Mexico, off Naples, Marco Island and Turtle Bay, was a shallow body of water, at least compared to the Atlantic. The bottom was fairly flat for a long way out: after an initial drop-off, it deepened about two feet per mile and was broken only by small ledges and man-made reefs. But because the depth was fairly shallow, the gulf could get violent fast. It was the underwater storm of sand and silt that had tipped her off to the one above. Though she did a lot of close-up, well-lit macrophotography, even that was looking grainy today.<br><br>Most people&#x2014;especially tourist divers from "the frozen North," as their dive friends called it&#x2014;thought the water off Naples was not great dive territory. But the twins had always loved it more than the glamour spots of the Keys or even the Caribbean. Fifteen feet of visibility in this part of the world was a great disappointment to some, but in the summers, the sea often went flat and turbulence was minimal. This part of the gulf was not crowded with divers, so it seemed pristine, with an abundance of wildlife like grouper, tarpon, rays, sea turtles, beautiful shells and, unfortunately at times, sharks. They also loved the gulf because that's where they'd learned to dive. It seemed so untouched, with the exception of the fact the reefs were man-made. But then, the natural coral reefs on the other coast were as endangered as the sea life would soon be here, if their project didn't help turn things around.<br><br>As she swam toward shore, roiling sand and silt and the thickening clouds made it too dark for her to be certain in what direction she was heading. Mostly, she went with the surge of the waves, which should take her in. Unfortunately, the tide was flowing out and the wind was fighting that, churning the water into a soupy maelstrom. She couldn't even read the luminous dial of the compass dive watch Daria had given her for their birthday last month. Daria and the boat... She could not imagine what might have happened, why her sister would desert her during a dive.<br><br>Surely nothing could have capsized Mermaids II, not a twenty-four-foot skiff with a flat bottom. There was no so-called Bermuda Triangle on this side of Florida. Yacht pirates and drug dealers wouldn't want a slow diver's boat. Smugglers had begun to bring in desperate refugees fleeing Cuba, and boats involved in the horrible human trafficking trade imported poverty-stricken Guatemalan women as domestic drudges or even sex slaves on both sides of the state. But those boats sneaked in at night to avoid being spotted or caught. Even if Daria had become ill, she wouldn't leave her. Nothing made sense.<br><br>In the murky water Bree could not read her air-pressure gauge, but she could feel the air through her mouthpiece becoming more difficult to breathe. Realizing her air was quickly running out, she surfaced. The waves were four feet now; she rode them up, down, sliding with their strength. It had started to rain. Which way was the shore?<br><br>She accidentally took in a mouthful of water, then spit it out. Swallowing salt water always made her nauseous. She was getting sick to her stomach anyway, furious and fearful. Dad had always said never to let your emotions rule your head, not when diving. In a way, after Mother died, that had become his credo for life. Just keep busy, so busy you don't have time for feelings, suffocating, desperate, drowning feelings...<br><br>Bree dropped her weight belt, ditched her tank with the quick-release straps and began breathing through her snorkel. The tank went under with a loud gurgle. She felt lighter&#x2014;better, she tried to buck herself up. She could make it in. Keewadin Island, long and narrow, must be ahead somewhere, maybe three miles or so. Thank God, she hadn't been at some of the more distant dive sites like Black Hole Sink or Naples Ledges, which were around thirty miles out.<br><br>She tried to convince herself that this was only the usual, quick afternoon summer storm, which would pepper the gulf, bathe the Everglades, then depart to leave a warm, humid evening. When would this summer weather break? Was she going to break?<br><br>Bree tried not to swallow water. Swimming was suddenly exhausting; despite her desperation to get ashore, she had to pace herself more. She slowed her strokes and kicks toward what she was certain must be land.<br><br>Stroke, stroke, stroke, breathe. Despite the outgoing tide, she was certain the waves must be pushing her along. But it was so far in. Hard to get good breaths. And then she heard it, the thing she feared most.<br><br>Thunder rumbling, coming. And that meant lightning.<br><br>Oh, no. Oh, no. Just last week, she had sat on their veranda at Turtle Bay and watched a storm like this. Forks of lightning had stabbed the gulf and then the bay just beyond the docks, coming closer, closer. As usual, the power had gone off for a while, but the twins weren't air-conditioner addicts like their older sister. Amelia almost never opened her windows, even in good weather. That would make her house dusty. Her poor kids, whom she kept so clean, could use a little dust and dirt.<br><br>Bree's muscles began to burn. She could hear Dad's voice telling her and Daria, "When in doubt, get out." Out, she wanted out. She wanted to be on the Mermaids II with Daria. She wanted to be home, safe and dry. She loved the water, loved the gulf, but not out here alone, tiring, so exhausted. Lord, please keep me safe. Daria, too. What happened? Daria, where are you?<br><br>A wave took one of her fins, and she had to kick the other off to avoid swimming askew. On, on, pull, pull, breathe, flee the thunder and lightning coming closer. She was starting to feel in the zone, like when she jogged several miles, but she was getting light-headed, dizzy, too.<br><br>The first distinct crack of lightning struck so close she flinched and shrieked into the mouthpiece of her snorkel. And then she saw another reason to scream. A big bull shark was swimming with her.<br><br></p><h2>Bugle Bead Bonanza: A Sparkling Collection of Jewelry Projects</h2><p>Popular beader Jamie Cloud Eakin uses bugle beads to make her fun, fantastic pieces, and she&#x2019;s showing other crafters how to do it, too!

Somewhere a woman was crying, a dog barked, and a horse-drawn cart rattled by. The stench of urine and blood burned her nostrils, but she moved forward.</p> <p>Two men. French-speakers, though only one was a native speaker. The other...the accent sounded Turkish? She turned her head to locate the voices.</p> <p>Closed door.</p> <p>Room at the end of the hall.</p> <p>Three steps. Two. One.</p> <p>She paused outside, drawing her knife. She didn't want to risk her pistol misfiring and left it tucked inside her coat, along with a stash of ball and powder. She was dressed as a man because the clothing was more practical and attracted less attention. She didn't think she'd fool anyone who looked closely. And she didn't care.</p> <p>A man inside the room-the Frenchman-spoke again, and her hand stilled on the door's latch.</p> <p>"Reaper is dead," she translated silently. "He took his life in prison."</p> <p>News traveled quickly, though not accurately. The report she'd seen claimed Fonc� had gained access to Reaper and slit his throat. The leader of the Ma�triser group didn't tolerate failure. When Fonc� realized she, an agent of his hated Barbican group, had tracked two of his men to this ramshackle flash ken, their lives would be forfeit as well. Perhaps that cold fact would be incentive for them to assist her in locating their leader.</p> <p>Or perhaps it would only make them more eager to kill her.</p> <p>Either way, the games were about to begin.</p> <p>She pulled her hand away from the door, stepped back, raised a booted foot, and kicked. The thin wooden door splintered and shot open with a loud crack. The men jumped up, but they didn't move quickly enough. Her knife flew from her fingers, catching one man in the shoulder and pinning him to the wall behind him. He screamed while the other man fumbled for his pistol. She obligingly reached for hers. "I'll kill you before you even pack your powder," she said in French. "Do us both a favor and lower your pistol before I'm forced to shoot you."</p> <p>"I don't owe you any favors, Bonde." The man holding the pistol sneered. He was called Tueur, and he was an assassin-one of Fonc�'s best now that Reaper was dead. She wished she'd thrown the knife at him. They'd met before and, since he had been trying to kill her at the time, had not parted amicably.</p> <p>But she could let bygones...and all of that rubbish. "That's Miss Bonde to you. Shall we have a little chat?"</p> <p>"No time today," he said and threw the pistol. Bonde ducked, and the weapon clattered to the floor behind her. She reached for it, tucked it in her waistband, then whirled back around. Tueur had wasted no time. He waved as he raced across the room and climbed out the window.</p> <p>She uttered a most unladylike expletive, her body pulled between Tueur and the Turk. She couldn't split in half-that was the disadvantage of working alone. Working with another agent-that was the disadvantage of a partner.</p> <p>She headed for the window, glancing at the Turk over her shoulder. A knife protruded from his neck. Tueur had made certain the other man wouldn't talk. He'd also made her decision easy. She leaned out the window and spotted Tueur hanging from the faded awning of the shop below. He dropped to the ground and made a rude gesture.</p> <p>Bygones were, apparently, not bygone in Tueur's opinion.</p> <p>She did a quick calculation then dove out the window, pulling her knees in so when she landed on the awning she would roll easily to the edge. She held her breath for the free fall and felt the air whoosh out of her when she hit the fabric.</p> <p>But she didn't roll.</p> <p>She heard an awful ripping sound and reached out just in time to catch the edge of the awning before she fell through. Her feet dangled above the hard cobblestones as the material slipped through her fingers. With a sigh, she let go, dropped, and tumbled. The ground was hard, bruising her hip and shoulder. She hobbled to her feet and wiped her bloody hands on her trousers. Where was the dashed man? She glared left and then right.</p> <p>Unfortunately, he'd seen her and took off at a fast clip.</p> <p>She went after him, her hip protesting the movement. Red clouded her vision, and she realized her forehead was bleeding. She swiped the blood away and rounded a corner, emerging onto a busy avenue lined with carts and vendors. Men and women walked leisurely along the avenue, shopping on the lovely spring day. Bollocks! Again she'd lost him. And on a crowded street, no less.</p> <p>Bonde noted a statue and raised fountain standing in a nearby esplanade, and she dodged horses and carriages to reach the monument. She climbed up, hanging on by one arm, and peered down the busy street. He was gone...no-wait.</p> <p>There! He'd climbed into a Bath chair, which two men were hastily pulling away. She jumped down, searching for another chair for hire and realized Tueur had taken the last. She glanced about, her attention landing on a sporty gig. A footman waited beside the horse, presumably while the vehicle's owner shopped for produce. Bonde ran for it, hopping up before the footman could protest. He stared at her dumbly for a moment, but when she snapped the reins, he grabbed for the horse's bridle.</p> <p>"Sorry!" she said, straining to control the skittish animal. The horse tried to rear and then shot off. Fortunately, the beast chose the direction she wanted. Unfortunately, he was going much too fast for the crowded avenue. Men and women jumped out of the way as she struggled to gain the upper hand. The Bath chair was just ahead, but the horse bolted to the side before she could jerk him back. The gig's wheel caught on the edge of a fruit stand, sending the vendor's cart toppling over. Oranges and lemons tumbled into the street, and apples bounced in every direction. One bounced into the conveyance, and she caught it with a hand, took a bite, and snapped the reins.</p> <p>She was grinning. She had Tueur now. He yelled furiously for the men pulling his chair to go faster, but they couldn't compete in a race with a horse. She gained ground until she finally pulled alongside the chair. "Ready for our chat now?" she yelled.</p> <p>"Go to the devil, Bonde!"</p> <p>"You first," she muttered, steering the horse closer to the chair so the men pulling it were forced to move aside. Tueur didn't wait for the inevitable. He rose and jumped from the chair, smashing onto the ground. She reined in the horse and jumped nimbly down, landing on her feet and running to grab Tueur before he could rise. She all but collided with a woman carrying an armful of flowers, and the woman tripped and went sprawling to the ground. Bonde spit a daffodil from her mouth and kept running. But the delay cost her. Tueur was up again and moving quickly toward a busy alleyway, where artists sold jewelry, paintings, and mementos. She pictured the city map in her mind. At the end of the alley was a canal. If Tueur reached the canal, he could jump on a vessel and she'd never catch him.</p> <p>She pushed two men out of the way and raced forward. Tueur saw her coming and began to jog. Some of the crowd saw them approach and parted, but others had to be thrust out of the way. Bonde jumped lithely over a stack of crates, wobbled, and regained her balance.</p> <p>Tueur was definitely headed for the canal. If she lost him, M would have her head. She sped up just as a young mother holding a little girl's hand stepped out from behind a stall. With a yell, Bonde narrowly avoided them and crashed into a flower cart. Everything went dark and floral for a moment, and when she surfaced, this time spitting tulip petals from her mouth, the flower girl screamed obscenities. At least Bonde thought they were obscenities. Amidst the haze of petals and stems, she'd forgotten in which country she'd landed and the native language spoken. She pulled a rose from her hair, handed it to the woman, and arrowed for the canal.</p> <p>Tueur was already there, and she saw his dilemma immediately. No vessels. Bonde reached for her pistol. She had him.</p> <p>He saw her coming then looked back at the water. Then back at her. He took a step forward.</p> <p>"No!"</p> <p>But it was already too late. He took two steps back and ran. She reached the edge of the canal as the water splashed back down, mud from below churning up and darkening the already filthy waterway.</p> <p>"Come up. Swim, damn you," she muttered. The ripples grew larger, and the water stilled. She stared at the place he'd gone under for a long moment, her gaze scanning the rest of the canal.</p> <p>Nothing moved.</p> <p>"Bollocks," she said.</p> <p>"Hey!"</p> <p>Bonde turned to see a crowd of angry merchants and shoppers approaching. Some waved damaged goods, some waved fists, some didn't have the courtesy to wave.</p> <p>"Bollocks," she said again. There was nothing for it. She pulled off her cap, allowing her golden hair to spill down her back, and smiled prettily.</p></p><h2>Mao Tse-tung On Guerrilla Warfare</h2><p>Book measures 6&#34; X 8.5&#34;. Grey Dust Jacket.

The designer, facing a blank sheet of paper or a computer screen, is anxious about the first step to take in developing a design. The elements of typography are an obvious starting point, but often do not get the attention they deserve. A thorough understanding of how letters, words, lines, paragraphs and columns are formed, what makes them unique as design elements, and how they express character and emotion are the most essential tools in the designer&#x2019;s repertoire. The basic principles of typographic design transform the utilitarian quality of words, lines, paragraphs and columns into an aesthetic form that conveys both the intellectual meaning and emotional feeling of the message. Through the relationship between the elements and space, and their rhythm and composition, design not only objectively conveys information but also gives subjective cues for the interpretation of its contents. As a visual form of language, typography is perceived as a whole before its individual parts are read. The surface characteristics of the design &#x2013; the topology &#x2013; create the first impression and derive from the form, size, position, and color of the typographic elements. Captured in a series of transparent diagrams, they reveal a new design dimension and animate the designer to further develop the original conceptual idea. This process provides the designer with a tool for refining, altering, adjusting, deconstructing and reassembling the individual levels to create a finely detailed, cohesive typographic composition.</p><p></p><h2>The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World: From the Archaic Age to the Arab Conquests</h2><p>Format Paperback Subject Literary Collections Publisher Cornell University Press</p><p>G.

C. Doherty's medieval mysteries are known for their gripping suspense, accuracy, and appealing characters. They have delighted readers with a blend of sleuthing, adventure, and vividly conveyed atmosphere - all wrapped around a mystery from the Middle Ages.<br>Murder Wears a Cowl, the sixth mystery featuring Hugh Corbett, a spy for Edward I, concerns a violent serial killer lurking in London, slitting the throats of prostitutes. When Lady Somerville, one of the Sisters of St. Martha, is murdered in the same barbaric fashion, followed by the suspicious death of Father Benedict, Edward I again calls on his trusted clerk, Hugh Corbett, to track the killer.</p><p>It is 1302 and England's Edward I is plagued by a revolt in Scotland, by the aggressive Philip IV of France and by the London slayings of a saintly old widow, a venerable priest and a string of prostitutes by "someone . . . holy," clad in a monk's cowl and sandals. (And although the king doesn't know it yet, someone has breached the supposedly impenetrable crypt at Westminster Abbey where the royal treasury lies hidden.) So Hugh Corbett, trusted Master of Clerks and Keeper of the Secret Seal, is tapped to unravel his sixth medieval mystery, following The Prince of Darkness. Prowling dark streets, visiting taverns and the Tower, hospitals and the Abbey, traveling by horseback on high roads and by barge on the misty Thames, he encounters cutpurses and cutthroats, Philip's evil emissary de Craon, master criminal Puddlicott, legless beggar Ragwort (who sleeps beneath dangling corpses at the hanging ground) and others in Doherty's large colorful cast. Despite occasional illogical plot devices and extraneous material, Doherty enthralls readers with vividly realized sights, sounds and stenches of 14th-century London and his graphic action set-pieces. Series hero Corbett is based on the real-life John de Droxford and most of the events described actually happened. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.YA-Hugh Corbett, a spy for Edward I, must track down a serial killer who slits the throats of prostitutes when the widow of one of Edward's comrade-in-arms is brutally murdered in the same way. Because Lady Somerville was a Sister of St. Martha, a pious group connected with Westminster Abbey's Chapter House, Hugh is soon investigating the bizarre and outrageous behavior rumored to be taking place in the half-built cathedral that houses the king's treasury in a secret vault. To add to his concerns, Richard Puddlicott, a notorious spy and master of disguise, has slipped into England for unknown reasons. Are these three different cases or three interwoven mysteries? Hugh and his bawdy servant fight, drink, and often lie their way through medieval England, where the villains are dastardly, the robberies daring, and the air is filled with the stench of rotting corpses. In the end, the unlikely murderer is unmasked, the king's gold secured, and the spy sent to the gallows. In an endnote, Doherty describes the actual events on which the novel is based. This galloping, historically accurate tale is one of his best.<br><i>Mary T.

The first book, printed in standard black ink, continues the inquiry into modern life and its discontents begun in <i>Days of War, Nights of Love .</i> Just as that book included improved versions of texts originally published between 1996 and 1999, this book draws on CrimethInc. material from 2000 to 2004, painstakingly refined and augmented with a great deal of new content. The second book, in red ink, is a composite account, related by three narrators, of the adventures and tribulations that inevitably ensue when people pursuing their dreams enter into conflict with the world as it is.<br><br>Together these comprise a third book, an exploration of the complex relationship between ideals and reality. Expect Resistance is a field manual for a field on which all manuals are useless, a meditation on individual transformation and collective resistance in disastrous times, and a masterpiece that raises the bar for radical publishing. <br><br> <b>Read and Reading Tremble</b><br><br> <i>CrimethInc.

Escaping exile in an alien dystopia, human beings storm paradise and, upon reentering, tear off their clothes without shame. God&#x2019;s judgment is overturned, nonsense is unlearned, a woman presents an apple to a snake, symbolizing the release of nature from the yoke of human will. Genders cease to be rigidly defined, each person becoming a complete unity of masculine and feminine characteristics. Finally, in only seven days&#x2019; time, the entirety of the old world is unmade, and on the last evening the lights of all cities, no longer powered by vast unsustainable infrastructures, blink out one by one.Crimethink is the stirrings of a new world, smuggled across every border in the heads and hearts of a dissident nation of millions, thrown through plate glass windows on notes tied to bricks. It is everything that evades control the stolen sick-day at the seashore, the shared meal free when the manager is away, the city street liberated for an hour during a demonstration, the dream that rebels and comes true. <br><br>CrimethInc. is the underground railroad from this world to the next.

In this country, activists engage in ecological civil disobedience and &#34;ecotage&#34;-- the sabotaging of equipment to prevent ecological damage-- in the struggle to preserve wilderness lands. These ecoteurs have gone beyond traditional conservation concerns to a new philosophy-- Deep Ecology, or biocentrism-- that calls into question not only the wisdom, but the legitimacy of humanity&#39;s domination of nature. In &#34;Green Rage&#34;, Christopher Manes has written a brilliant defense of radical environmentalism, challenging the ethics of modern industrial society and asserting the right of the natural world to blossom, evolve, and exist for its own sake.</p><p>The end is at hand, declares Manes, and radical measures are needed to avoid an ecological disaster. He decries industrial society's assault on the natural world and lionizes those, such as the group Earth First! (of which Manes is a member), who are taking direct action to halt these incursions. The acts Manes admiringly recounts include scuttling whaling vessels, destroying bulldozers, and driving spikes into trees slated to be cut. Even mainstream environmental groups, such as the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Society, are objects of his scorn, because of the timidity of their positions and recommendations. This is well-written, riveting, angry work. You do not need to agree with all of Manes's assertions to find his book provocative and challenging.

Challenged by race, by class, and by a longing for home, here are "safari boys" and samaritans, reporters bent on their own fame, travelers who care deeply about elephants but not at all about the people of Africa. They all know each other. They meet at dinner parties, they sleep with each other, they argue about politics and the best way to negotiate their existence in a place where they don't really belong. <br><br>At the center is Esm�, a beautiful young woman of dazzling ironies and introspections, who tells us her story in a voice both passionate and self-deprecating. Against a paradoxical backdrop of limitless physical freedom and escalating civil unrest, Esm� struggles to make sense of her own place in Africa and of her feelings for the two men there whom she loves--Adam, a second-generation Kenyan who is the first to show her the wonders of her adopted land, and Hunter, a British journalist sickened by its horrors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><b>Rules of the Wild</b> evokes the worlds of Isak Dinesen, Beryl Markham, and Ernest Hemingway. It explores unforgettably our infinite desire for a perfect elsewhere, for love and a place to call home. It is an astonishing literary debut.</p><p>Things have certainly changed in Kenya since the 1930s, when Baroness Karen Blixen (a.k.a. Isak Dinesen, author of <i>Out of Africa</i>) had a farm at the foot of the Ngong Hills. In Francesca Marciano's <i>Rules of the Wild</i>, the Blixen spread has become an affluent white suburb of Nairobi, home to the tony "Karen" Shopping Mall and populated by a new breed of narcissistic young expatriates and second-generation white Africans. Esme, the beautiful twentysomething Italian narrator, lands in Kenya by happenstance, seeking to escape a painful past and the recent death of her beloved father. Captivated by the sheer physical beauty of the landscape and the raw honesty of her new "tribe," Esme is further ensnared by her love for two dynamic men--one a gentle 1990s version the Great White Hunter, the other an angry journalist obsessed by the carnage of Somalia and Rwanda. In her eminently readable novel, Marciano creates a hip, knowing set of characters who are ironically aware that their easy lifestyle, supported by trust funds and cheap labor, contrasts darkly with the poverty and decay of east Africa. Esme, an intense and thoughtful observer of the scene, struggles not only with the desire to test herself, "to love without illusion, to love without feeling safe", but with what it means to be white in Africa, living in bizarre isolation from the native culture, drawing spiritual sustenance from the land but protected from the continent's turmoil. Finally, the passion she develops for Kenya roots her and gives her purpose, a home. As one of her friends observes, "I'll tell you what it is about this place.... It sentences you to freedom ... you are constantly reminded of what it means to be free and to be alive. And then it becomes difficult to settle for anything less than this." <i>--Marianne Painter</i>In this mesmerizing novel, Francesca Marciano evokes the startlingly exotic world of contemporary expatriates living in Nairobi. Relief workers befriend wildlife researchers, artists exchange their intimate secrets with documentary filmmakers. They meet at dinner parties, they make love, they argue about the best way to negotiate their existence in a land they can never hope to claim.<p>At the center of it all is the young and beautiful Esme, a free spirit in search of love and a place to call home. She thinks she has found what she is looking for in Adam, a safari leader with an almost holy appreciation of the terrain. Then she meets Hunter, a spitfire journalist outraged by the poverty and violence in which most Africans live.</p><p>Combining the romanticism of Isak Dinesen with language reminiscent of Ernest Hemingway, Marciano juxtaposes the magnificent beauty of the Kenyan landscape with the human capacity for carelessness and brutality. Erotic, sensual, lush with detail and insight, Rules of the Wild evokes a land that demands catharsis and a heroine suddenly, achingly, alive.</p></p><h2>In the School of Love</h2><p>Christ&#39;s new commandment to us was, Love One Another. He repeatedly admonished all who came to listen to His words to &#34;love&#34; as the basis for their earthly existence. He still pleads to His people today for that same special commitment. Unfortuntely, we seem no closer to understanding this new commandment today, than were the people of Jesus&#39; time. The world devestated by violence, greed, hatred, and pride, is still searching for peace and love. In this book, In the School of Love, Fr. Slavko Barbaric has assembled many of the messages given by Our Lady in Medjugorje along with his own meditations into a blueprint for this struggling world and its need to find peace and love.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Serbo-Croation</p><h2>Joyful Noise</h2><p>Music stirs powerful emotions and illumines divine truth, and has been at the heart of Christian worship since biblical times. Now more than ever, congregational song shapes our understanding and experience of God. In his new work <i>Joyful Noise: A Guide to Music in the Church for Pastors and Musicians,</i> William S. Smith explores the contemporary issues affecting worship music and the roles of clergy and staff in shaping the church's musical experience. Drawing on his deep knowledge of hymnology and current musical styles, Smith invites us to a fresh exploration of the ancient art that brings us closer to God.</p><p>William S. Smith was a Fulbright scholar at the Free University of Amsterdam, where he earned his doctorate in theology. His dissertation is titled "Musical Aspects of the New Testament." Smith engaged in theological education in Brazil for twelve years, and served Presbyterian pastorates in Louisiana and Tennessee. Since 1984, he has been active in The Hymn Society in the United States and Canada, and has contributed several articles to that society s journal, <i>The Hymn</i>. Smith is the compiler of <i>Hymnsearch: Indexes for</i> The Presbyterian Hymnal (1995). Married to a church organist, Smith currently serves as chaplain to a local chapter of the American Guild of Organists.Like its title, this book contains delightful and joyful surprises. It also offers sober truth about church music. Read it! --Donald P. Hustad, Senior Professor of Church Music and Worship, Souther Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>At last, a sensible, exciting, helpful treatment of the subject of the roles of musicians and pastors in the worship life of every church. Every possible subject is well covered with pastoral sensitivity, and with comprehensive bibliographical lists. This is a book which every church should buy for its pastor and musician. Enthusiastically recommended! --Austin c. Lovelace, DSM, AAGO, Fellow and Past President of the Hymn Society<br><br>I have known William Smith for a number of years through my work with The Hymn Society in the United States and Canada and through the Presbyterian Association of Musicians, and I have also known him to be a serious thinker about congregational song. This book is a great way to begin a discussion between clergy and musicians regarding the role of music in worship. Buy copies for your staff colleagues and discuss it together! --David E.

An archaeologist intrigued by the arcane, Annja pursues the truth about the vessel and its ancient origins.<br>Her search leads her to a confrontation with a London cult driven by visions of a new world order; and a religious zealot fueled by the insatiable desire for glory. Across the sands of the Middle East to the jungles of Brazil, Annja embarks on a relentless chase to stop humanity's most unfathomable secrets from reshaping the modern world.</p><p>On long tanned legs Annja Creed ran through the hard-wood forest. Rays from the sun hanging precariously above the great mountains slanted like pale gold lances at random between the boles. They caressed her sweaty face like velvet gloves as she ran through them.<p> </p><p>Despite sweating in the heat, she breathed normally, dodging thicker stands of brush, crashing through the thinner ones. Late-season insects trilled around her and in sporadic spectral clouds tried to fly up her nose and into her mouth. The birds chattered and called to one another in the trees. The woods smelled of green growth and mostly dried decayed vegetation, not at all the way she imagined a true rain forest might smell, lower down in the Amazon basin proper. Up in the watershed of the Amazon's tributary the R�o Mara��n, in eastern Peru, the early autumn was drier and cooler, the growth far less dense.</p><p> </p><p>Her heart raced as much as any person's might have after running at high speed for over two miles, up and down steep ridges. It had little to do with the exertion, though.</p><p> </p><p>She ran for her life.</p><p> </p><p>DAYLIGHT CAME LATE and evening early to the small</p><p> </p><p>Peruvian village of Chiriqui. The sun had rolled well past the zenith. Though shadows weren't yet very long, it wasn't far from vanishing behind the tree-furred ridge to the west when the blast of a diesel engine ripped the calm air.</p><p> </p><p>Beyond the ridge loomed the mighty peaks of the Andes themselves, looking close enough to topple and crush the little village into its dusty hillside, their blue tinge hinting how far away they really stood. The hills were mostly covered in patchy grass, dry as the hot Southern Hemisphere summer ended. Stands of hard-wood forest rose on some of the heights, interspersed with tough scrub.</p><p> </p><p>Chickens flapped their wings in annoyance and fled squawking as a big blue Dodge Ram 2500, battered and sun faded, rolled into the small plaza in the midst of the collection of a couple of dozen huts. A tethered spider monkey shrilled obscenities and ran up a pole supporting a thatch awning as the vehicle clipped the edge of a kiosk and spilled colorful fruits bouncing across the tan hard-packed dirt. The owner remonstrated loudly as the vehicle stopped in a cloud of exhaust and dust.</p><p> </p><p>Men began bailing out of the truck's extended bed. Men dressed in green-and-dust-colored camouflage who carried unmistakable broken-nosed Kalashnikovs and grenades clipped on their vests like green mango clusters.</p><p> </p><p>They were gringos, unmistakably, who towered over the small brown villagers. The vehicle sported a powerful Soviet-era PKS machine gun mounted on a roll bar right behind the cab.</p><p> </p><p>The people of Chiriqui knew better than to call attention to themselves when such visitors came to town.</p><p> </p><p>"Gather 'round," the apparent leader commanded in clear but <i>norteamericano</i>-accented Spanish. He wore a short-sleeved camo blouse, a similarly patterned baseball cap atop his crewcut red head, and carried a black semiautomatic pistol in an open-top holster tied down his right thigh like a movie gunslinger.</p><p> </p><p>Unlike people familiar with such things only from watching television from the comforts of their dens, the villagers knew well the difference between semi and full automatic.</p><p> </p><p>The villagers stared, more as if their worst nightmares were coming true than from any lack of comprehension. Because, of course, that was exactly what was happening. The gringo soldiers with their hard faces grinning mean white grins spread out in pairs with rifles at the ready to enforce their leader's command.</p><p> </p><p>IN THE RELATIVE COOL of her hut Annja Creed sat straining to read by the light coming in by dribs and drabs through gaps in the hardwood-plank wall. A bare bulb hung by a frayed cord perilously low over her head at the table on which she had spread the ancient book. It was unlit. The people of the village of Chiriqui had already done more than enough for her; she had firmly but with effusive thanks refused their offers to burn up more of their scarce, precious fuel to run the generator to provide artificial illumination. She could smell hot earth outside, the thatch, the sun-dried and splitting planks of the walls.And most of all the familiar musty odor of an ancient volume.</p><p> </p><p><i>"...herb has most salubrious effects,"</i> she read,<i> "particularly with regards to ye falling sickness, the effects of which fit it serves to ameliorate most expeditiously..."</i></p><p> </p><p>That was how she would have translated it into English, anyway. The Jesuit Brother Jo�o da Concep��o's seventeenth-century Portuguese gave her no problems; modern Portuguese had changed less in the intervening centuries than most languages. Even other Romance languages, which if translated literally tended to sound archaic and formal even at street level to English ears.</p><p> </p><p>She knew her Romance languages. She knew the majors, Spanish, French, Italian and, of course, Portuguese. Plus she was rudely conversant in some of the minors, such as Catalan. Of the whole group she knew little of Romanian. She read and wrote Latin superbly; it had formed the core of her language study since she had learned it in the Catholic orphanage in New Orleans.</p><p> </p><p>What gave her fits was Brother Jo�o's crabgrass handwriting. The ink had faded to a sort of faint burgundy hue on the water-warped pages of the ancient journal. In some places water spots or mold obscured the text entirely. In others the words faded entirely from visibility as of their own accord.</p><p> </p><p>"This would probably be easier if I went outside in the direct sun," she said aloud. She had a tendency to talk to herself. It was one of several reasons--that she knew of--that the villagers called her <i>la gringa loca</i>, the Crazy White Lady. That she spoke Spanish and was willing to share her medical supplies or give impromptu English lessons to the local kids--or their elders--helped keep the inflection friendly when they said it, so all was well.</p><p> </p><p>As for going out in the sun, she'd had about enough of it in the weeks she'd spent tramping the hills looking for the tome. It wasn't as hot there as it was down lower in the Selva, the great jungle of the Upper Amazon. But to compensate, the high-altitude sun was more intense, with less air to block the UV rays that punished her fair skin. And it was hot enough. Even in the shade of the hut she had to keep constantly on her guard to prevent sweat from running the line of her chestnut hair, tied back with a russet bandanna, and dripping off her nose onto the priceless pages.</p><p> </p><p>"Anyway," she said, aloud again, "I'm just being impatient. I could just wait till I'm back at the hotel."</p><p> </p><p>Having searched a month to find the book, she was eager to confirm its contents. However, she was still a day or two from any kind of reliably illuminated, not to mention air-conditioned, surroundings; she was meeting a farmer from up in the hills about sunset. He had agreed to give her a lift into the nearest town of consequence in his venerable pickup.</p><p> </p><p>Annja's impatience was rewarded. It seemed that the hints she'd been pursuing had been correct. The long-dead friar had cataloged a wealth of herbs of the Upper Amazon and watershed, along with a remarkable accounting of their observable effects on various maladies so systematic that it prefigured the scientific method. She wondered if an early stint in China, with its extensive <i>materia medica</i> assembled over millennia, and its own tradition of systematic observation and trial and error, had influenced him.</p><p> </p><p>Excitement thrilled through her veins as she carefully paged through the book, reading passages, looking at the pictures Brother Jo�o had drawn in almost obsessive detail. She knew nothing about botany, and even the mid-seventeenth century was straying beyond her actual scope of formal training, which was medieval and Renaissance Europe. But since she had taken on this new life, she'd found herself constantly expanding her horizons.</p><p> </p><p>She was barely conscious of the outlaw-motorcycle rumble and snarl of the diesel truck pulling into the plaza. None of the villagers possessed a motor vehicle, but a few, mostly pickup trucks, wandered through Chiriqui almost every day.</p><p> </p><p>"Senorita," a childish voice said, low and urgent behind her. She turned.</p><p> </p><p>"What is it, Luis?" she asked the tiny figure who stood in the door, a tattered T-shirt hanging halfway down his bare brown legs. His eyes were great anthracite disks of concern beneath his thatch of untamed black hair.</p><p> </p><p>"You must go," he said.</p><p> </p><p>He looks so innocent, she thought, not overly concerned despite his apparent urgency. She knew how kids tended to dramatize.</p><p> </p><p>"Why?" she asked.</p><p> </p><p>His eyes grew bigger and his voice more grave. "Bad men come," he said.</p><p> </p><p>From outside came the sudden, unmistakable clatter of automatic gunfire.</p><p> </p><p>THE VILLAGERS CROWDED into the square and stared as one at the man who lay writhing on the slope across the stream, guts and pelvis pulped by a burst of steel-jacketed rifle bullets. The stink of burned propellant and lubricant stung the air.</p><p> </p><p>"My, my," the intruders' leader said, wagging his head reprovingly. "You people are slow learners. Don't you know by now that when we come around you don't run, because you'll only die tired?"</p><p> </p><p>For a moment there was no sound but the pinging of the truck as it cooled and the groans of the mortally injured man. "Don Pepe, front and center," the redheaded man in the ball cap commanded.</p><p></p></p><h2>On the Sources of Patriarchal Rage: The Commonplace Books of William Byrd and Thomas Jefferson and the Gendering of Power in the Eighteenth Century (History of Emotions, 5)</h2><p><p>"A brilliant . . . analysis of the fragile hegemony and identities of colonial Virginia's elite men. . . . <i>On the Sources of Patriarchal Rage</i> compellingly illuminates the ragged edge where masculinity and colonial identity meet. . . .

These books are witnesses to the events in which two men assembled their culture, literally enacted or embodied it in these books of themselves, on the issue of gender. The books are simultaneously confessionals. They are confessionals of intense personal crises of gender relations. Were these outbursts meaningless and isolated incidents, or were they rare revelations of the pressures on such gentlemen to maintain patriarchal control? Kenneth Lockridge leads us on an exploration of the possible structures, contexts and significances of these great mythmakers&#39; misogynistic moments. Each outburst draws upon a kind of &#34;misogynistic reserve&#34; available in the continental and English intellectual traditions, but each also twists and re-contexts less misogynistic excerpts to intensified effect. From the interplay of intellectual traditions, personal re-contextings, and the circumstances of each man&#39;s life and later behavior, arises the possibility that one or more specific &#34;politics of misogyny&#34; is at work here, and that these reenactments of culture are redolent of the stresses on the male subject in the eighteenth century in general and among Virginia gentry in particular. The essay is an opening of these texts only, and a reflection on their possible meanings in the wider contexts of gender and power in the eighteenth century. That rage waspresent seems clear; but its meanings - here suggestively explored - must remain contestable.Trained under Frank Craven and Lawrence Stone, <b>Kenneth A.

(&#34;Why he was esteemed as an Indian fighter is puzzling,&#34; Connell remarks. &#34;None of his frontier campaigns demonstrated particular skill or insight.&#34;) Connell also examines the lives of Captain Frederick Benteen and Major Marcus Reno, the admirable General George Crook, and their foes Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and Rain in the Face. Reno comes out worst: he held the dubious distinction of having the worst record before or since in the history of the United States Military Academy, and he was dishonorably discharged for incompetence after failing to get his column into battle in time to save Custer&#39;s command. Connell&#39;s thrilling story has all the inevitability of a tragedy, but there are no tragic heroes to which to point.Evan S. Connell, long recognised as one of the most important American literary voices, is the author of seventeen books, including Mrs. Bridge, Mr. Bridge, Deus lo Volt: A Chronicle of the Crusades and El Dorado &amp; Other Pursuits (both available in Pimlico).

Mark tries his best, but he is unable to win Becky for himself--until he meets Vincent and Kara and strange things start to happen.</p><p>When Mark, 18, meets Becky, he's sure it's love. But Becky is involved with Ray, 20, and isn't interested in a new relationship. Then Mark befriends Kara and Vincent, a young couple new to the area. Kara soon embarks on a mission to turn Becky against Ray, thus paving the way for Mark, who's puzzled by Kara's determination. He eventually learns that Kara is Becky, some 40 years into the future. She's been given the chance to travel back in time and rectify her past in order to prevent World War III. The plot is amazingly convoluted: the story is even more confusing than it sounds. Too many disparate elements are thrown in: romance, computer programming, time travel, murder, space stations, maniacal military leadership and intergalactic aliens. Pike's writing shows a definite comedic flair, but nothing can compensate for this muddled maze of a novel.

Burgon&#39;s book, The Traditional Text of the Gospels. It is also included in the Sovereign Grace Publishers title, Unholy Hands on the Bible, Volume I, now in its third printing. Many readers of this volume have desired a reprint of this powerful expose of the multitude of errors which are embedded in the modern day versions. It is for this reason that this low-priced paperback is being produced, that the defenders of the inerrancy of the Scriptures may have an affordable book to give away. WHAT YOU WILL FIND IN THIS FACT-FILLED BOOK 1. Before your eyes, you will see how some errors originated. 2. Dozens of examples demonstrate the unreliability of the Egyptian manuscripts (on which the NA/UBS Greek and nearly all modern versions in many cases depend entirely,) with their contradictions, absurdities, scientific impossibilities, and other errors inserted into their &#39;&#39;Holy Bible.&#39;&#39; 3. You will see how fictitious characters happened to be inserted (such as &#39;&#39;Titius Justus).&#39;&#39; 4. You will see how a sleepy Egyptian scribe skipped a line, or even two, because the lines ended in the same Greek letters. 5. Causes of many scriptural words now being deleted, or bracketed by textual critics, are explained, to their shame. 6. Corruption of the Lord&#39;s Prayer, Matthew 6:13 (by deleting the doxology in the last words of it) is fully exposed by a simple explanation. These words appear in more than 2,000 manuscripts, are missing from only nine manuscripts. Burgon asks, How did they get into in all those mss.? You will even learn that six of the Greek words of this doxology appear exactly in the Apostle&#39;s Paul&#39;s heavenly doxology in 2 Timothy 4:18. Then an even more satisfying discovery may be made of why and how the modern versions make a mess of the Lord&#39;s Prayer in Luke. See pages 40-42. 7. Burgon explains why it is absurd for the New Versions to convict Matthew and Mark of ig</p><p>John William Burgon was born August 21, 1813. He matriculated at Oxford in 1841, taking several high honors there, and his B.A. 1845. He took his M.A. there in 1848...the thing about Burgon, however, which lifts him out of the nineteenth century English setting and endears him to the hearts of earnest Christians of other lands and other ages is his steadfast defense of the scriptures as the infallible Word of God. He strove with all his power to arrest the modernistic currents which during his lifetime had begun to flow within the Church of England, continuing his efforts with unabated zeal up to the very day of his death. With this purpose in mind he labored mightily in the field of New Testament textual criticism. In 1860, while temporary chaplain of the English congregation at Rome, he made a personal examination of Codex B (Vaticanus), and in 1862 he inspected the treasures of St. Catherine&#39;s Convent on Mt. Sinai. Later he made several tours of European libraries, examining and collating New Testament manuscripts wherever he went...Of all the critics of the nineteenth century Burgon alone was consistently Christian in his vindication of the Divine inspiration and providential preservation of the text of Holy Scripture.</p><h2>Great Irish Tales of Horror A Treasury of Fear</h2><p>Horror is in the mind and of the darkness. Those who seek to indulge in nightmare will find more than enough here to set their pulses racing - satanic figures grope in the shadows, people long dead return to haunt the scenes of their lifetime, victims fly shrieking from a doom they cannot escape. Drawn from 200 years of short story writing, &#34;Great Irish Tales of Horror&#34; includes twenty-four of the most powerful examples of horror ever conceived. Many of them are all the more terrifying because the looming dread is understated or unseen: food for the imagination.</p><p></p><h2>New Haven Power, 1838-1968: Steam, Diesel, Electric, MU's, Trolleys, Motor Cars, Buses &amp; Boats</h2><p>Massive compilation of the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad's equipment.

They played significant roles in the development of the art schools, galleries, and arts organizations that make the Twin Cities a major cultural center today. Yet their strong reputations were eclipsed mid-century by the rise of Abstract Expressionism and other male-dominated modernist movements.<br> Drawing on unpublished papers, contemporaneous accounts, and interviews with their students, descendants, and collectors, Pioneer Modernists presents a new picture of their cosmopolitan art training, multi-faceted careers, and sometimes unconventional lives, set in the context of the tumultuous events of the twentieth century. It examines their work (paintings, prints, decorative work, and sculptures) in terms of its humanistic ideas, technical sophistication, and visual appeal. By relating this work to national and international art movements, Pioneer Modernists contributes to a new understanding of Modernism as richly diverse.<br> This study grows out of a 2007 exhibition at the Minnesota Museum of American Art, "In Her Own Right: Minnesota's First Generation of Women Artists."

After hearing Madama Butterfly on the radio one day, Robert Remsen "Barefoot" Rainfield decides to "become an opera singer and dedicate his voice to the music of Puccini." The determined bruin hops a bus to St. Paul, and after a stunning debut at a local diner (he's paid in pancakes), La Scala's maestro whisks him off to Italy to sing at the world's most famous opera house. Sundgaard has a puckish sense of humor (instead of autographs, for example, Barefoot hands out pawprints on cafe menus, and La Scala's offer--"We'll double the pancakes, triple the maple syrup"--is served up in campy Hollywood agent style), and the story errs only in its rather heavy moralizing--follow your dreams, no matter how impossible they might seem. Rendered in becoming tones of browns and blues, Catalano's muted pastel illustrations echo the understated wit of this upbeat tale.

And so she travels to Europe as a passenger on a tanker bound through the Panama Canal. But Panama is a country whose politics are as volatile as the local freedom fighters. When Hisako's ship is captured, it is not long before the atmosphere is as flammable as an oxy-acetylene torch, and the tension as sharp as the spike on her cello...<br><br>CANAL DREAMS is a novel of deceptive simplicity and dark, original power: stark psychological insights mesh with vividly realised scenarios in an ominous projection of global realpolitik. The result is yet another major landmark in the quite remarkable career of an outstanding modern novelist.</p><p>Iain Banks came to widespread and controversial public notice with the publication of his first novel, THE WASP FACTORY, in 1984. He gained enormous popular and critical acclaim for both his mainstream and his science fiction novels. Iain Banks died in June 2013.``Dreams'' is right, as Yukio Mishima meets Hiroshima mon amour in this spare, hallucinatory novel about a world-class Japanese cellist taken hostage in a terrorist coup. Hisako Onoda, whose fear of flying has forced her to take ship on a freighter for her European concert tour, has been spending the interregnum floating on a Panama lake while the canal is closed by political unrest, brooding on her earlier losses and achievements--her widowed mother's sacrifices to pay for her lessons, her growing mastery of her instrument, her obligatory affairs--and taking up with Philippe, a French officer aboard Le Cercle. The political extremists who liberate the tanker (together with two other ships trapped on the lake) dramatically change the course of Hisako's life but not the texture of her narrative--as the slaughter of passengers and crew, Hisako's recital for and meeting with chief terrorist Earl Dandridge (CIA, of course), and her surrealistic bout of counterterrorism alternate with further memories of her traumatic first airline flight and the man she killed during an airport riot. Plenty of violence, all right--first Dandridge's men, then Hisako, fire at every available target--but it all seems to take place underwater: memory, dream, and reality merge as the novel drifts toward a symbolic holocaust. Banks (The Bridge, etc.) sets up the usual melodramatic premises of the genre but then sidesteps them for atmosphere and enigma, like the closing episodes of Twin Peaks. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The art of optical illusion has been an integral part of painting since antiquity, when it was used as a yardstick by which to judge an artist&#39;s level of mastery. In the centuries that followed, and continuing through contemporary times, artists from Van Eyck to Gerhard Richter have delighted in &#34;tricking the eye.&#34; That practice has extended to outdoor spaces with the likes of Banksy and Cayetano Ferrer.

Teaming up with trail hand Whip Holt, widow Claudia Humphries, and a colourful group of courageous pioneers, Brentwood sets off from New York, heading westward to Independence, Missouri - the last outpost of civilization before the unknown and treacherous dangers of a new frontier. Along the way they will form unbreakable friendships, fight unforeseen enemies, and face unimaginable and often fatal odds.

It&#39;s all a little larger than life and much neater, but a good yarn. Reader Tom Morgan plunges into this epic with assurance in a light, pleasant voice well-suited to prolonged listening. His character voices are lightly drawn but consistent enough for clarity, and he commands a wide range of regional accents.

Unsheltered people sleep in doorways, scavengers with huge plastic sacks full of empty beer and soda cans head for the markets to cash them in, work crews wait in front of buildings for the super to show up. Runners are bouncing up and down at the curb waiting for lights to change. Cops are in coffee shops dealing with bagel deficiencies. Kids, parents, and nannies wheeled and afoot are heading in all different directions for schools in the neighborhood. Half the kids seem to be on new Razor scooters, so to the list of things to keep alert for add ambush by rolling aluminum.</p><h2>My Vision</h2><p>In 2004, the international embargo and sanctions that had been imposed on Libya for more than a decade were lifted by the UN Security Council when Colonel Muammar Gadaffi announced that Libya would give up its nuclear weapons. Further, Gadaffi agreed to compensate the families of the victims of the Lockerbie bombing and the attack on the TWA flight that occurred in the late 1980s. This remarkable gesture showed Gaddafi&#x2019;s commitment to seeing Libya rejoin the international community. In the sprit of reconciliation, Prime Minister Tony Blair flew to Tripoli, declaring that Libya was now an ally in the fight against global terrorism. How is this reversal explained? Born from conversations between Gaddafi and political expert Edmond Jouve, this book retraces the Libyan leader's political and ideological journey.</p><p>Born in 1943 into the El Gaddafi tribe, Muammar Gaddafi left his family circle at the age of ten. Keen on geopolitics - passionate about decolonisation and the epic Nasserian movement - he studied the mechanisms of state both in Tripoli and in Great Britain. He has ruled Libya since 1969. A specialist in Third-World Africa, Professor Edmond Jouve has regularly met with Muammar Gaddafi since 1979. Author, notably of The Right of Peoples and The Third World, he teaches political science at Rene Descartes University in Paris.This breezy but well-researched history takes a not-so-critical look at a man described by Nelson Mandela as "one of the greatest revolutionary legends of our times" and by President Ronald Reagan as "the mad dog of the Middle East." The leader of Libya since 1969, Gaddafi's life story is revealed through the interviews and research of Jouve, an expert in Third-World Africa who first met Gaddafi in 1979. Told from Gaddafi's point of view, this book portrays him as a leader of conviction and consideration, committed to peaceably bettering the lives of his countrymen, historically threatened by the influence of the Zionists and the Western traditions they bring to the Middle East with them. Jouve details this anti-Zionism largely without critical comment-which may bristle Western audiences-except for that provided by Gaddafi himself, who in 2004 gave up his nuclear weapons in order to reconcile with the West, a move Jouve says is "the result of deep thought and soul-searching." Whether or not you believe in his transformation (and to be sure, Jouve doesn't provide any reasons why you shouldn't), Gaddafi's perspective is well represented here and should satisfy anyone interested in man, the march of Islamic democracy, or the perspective of an "enlightened Muslim" on Israel, the west, democracy and terrorism.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Through his anecdotes the author shares with the reader what can be learned of the habits of animals through keen observation over a long period of time&#x2014;details that elude the casual visitor to the woods.</p><p>William Joseph Long (1857-1952) was an American writer, naturalist and minister who lived and worked in Stamford, Connecticut. As a naturalist, Long left Stamford every March, often with his two daughters Lois and Cesca, to travel to &#34;the wilderness&#34; of Maine. There they would stay until the first snows of October, although sometimes he would stay all winter. In the 1920s, he began spending his summers in Nova Scotia, claiming &#34;the wilderness is getting too crowded&#34;. Long wrote of his wilderness experiences in the books Ways of Wood Folk, Wilderness Ways, Wood-folk Comedies, Northern Trails, Wood Folk at School, and many others. Long believed that the best way to experience the wild was to plant yourself and sit for hours on end to let the wild &#34;come to you; and they will!&#34;.</p><h2>Hokusai</h2><p>Hokusai was one of the great masters of the Japanese woodblock print.

H. Davies surprised his contemporaries with the unlikeliest portrait of the artist as a young man ever written.<br><br>After a delinquent childhood Davies renounced home and apprenticeship and at twenty-two sailed to America&#x2014;the first of more than a dozen Atlantic crossings, often made by cattle boat. From 1893 to 1899 he was schooled by the hard men of the road, disdaining regular work and subsisting by begging. Crossing Canada to join the &#x201c;Klondyke&#x201d; gold rush, Davies fell while hopping a train. His foot was crushed and his leg amputated. &#x201c;All the wildness had been taken out of me,&#x201d; Davies wrote, &#x201c;and my adventures after this were not of my own seeking.&#x201d;<br><br>Praised by Osbert Sitwell for his &#x201c;primitive splendour and directness,&#x201d; Davies evokes the beauty and frontier violence of turn-of-the-century America in prose that George Bernard Shaw commended to &#x201c;literary experts for its style alone.&#x201d; The insurgent wanderlust that found an American voice in Jack London and Jack Kerouac is expressed here in a raucous true adventure story by the man Shaw called &#x201c;the incorrigible Supertramp who wrote this amazing book.&#x201d;</p><p>A popular yet idiosyncratic poet, <b>W.

It combines Brown&#39;s years of professional automotive experience with down-to-earth language even an automotive beginner can understand. It is not written for the engineer in the laboratory, but for the home mechanic building his own car, and for the average person behind the wheel. Brown speaks to the reader as if talking to a friend in his garage. Before lifting a wrench, Brown answers the most frequently asked questions about electric cars: how fast will it go, how far will it go, how long will the batteries last, how pollution-free is it really, and many more. The conversion process itself begins with choosing an appropriate donor chassis, and stripping it of internal combustion components. Here Brown&#39;s experience provide numerous tips and tricks to make the later conversion process easier and more successful. Step by step, Brown leads the reader through the conversion. As each component comes up, Brown gives a little background on the different types available, and the pros and cons of each. He includes tips on layout, design and fabrication at each step, and discusses different approaches for different chassis, such as front wheel drive vs. rear wheel drive. By the end of the book, every part of the conversion process has been discussed. Brown wraps up with a procedure for testing and troubleshooting, and guidelines for normal driving, charging, and maintenance. The book is salted heavily throughout with photos and diagrams to illustrate its topics, and it includes a very thorough index. CONVERT IT has been chosen by the Department of Energy and by numerous schools across the country as the textbook for high school electric car conversion projects.</p><p>A lot of people make electric cars very complicated, and they don&#39;t need to be. I believe in keeping it simple. Over the years, I&#39;ve learned a lot of tricks that can help the builder, and a lot of pitfalls that should be avoided. I want to share the benefits of my experience.CONVERT IT explodes the common myths about electric cars. It explains: Why they are tremendously cleaner than internal combustion cars--even including the used batteries and the emissions from the power generating plants. Why they are more energy-efficient than internal combustion cars--even including electric power transmission losses. Why they are much more economical to operate than internal combustion cars--even including periodic battery pack replacements. Why they are perfectly practical for the driving most Americans do today--even using plain old DC motors and lead-acid batteries. Why they won&#39;t create a need for new power plant construction--even if there are millions of them on the road. Why they are the cars of the future--AND the cars of today!</p><h2>Quanah Parker, Comanche Chief (Oklahoma Western Biographies, Vol. 6) (Volume 6)</h2><p><p>The son of white captive Cynthia Ann Parker, Quanah Parker rose from able warrior to tribal leader on the Comanche reservation. Between 1875 and his death in 1911, Quanah dealt with local Indian agents and with presidents and other high officials in Washington, facing the classic dilemma of a leader caught between the dictates of an occupying power and the wrenching physical and spiritual needs of his people. He maintained a remarkable blend of progressive and traditional beliefs, and contrary to government policy, he practiced polygamy and the peyote religion.

She married Chaplin in Empalme, Mexico in November 1924. <br> <br>The Chaplins stayed together for two years. Lita bore Chaplin two sons: Charles Chaplin, Jr. and Sydney Chaplin. In November 1926, after Lita discovered that Chaplin was having an affair with Merna Kennedy (Lita's best friend, whom she had persuaded Chaplin to hire as the leading lady in <i>The Circus</i>), Lita left Chaplin and filed for divorce. It was one of the first divorce cases to receive a public airing. The divorce complaint ran a staggering 42 pages and fed scandal with its revelations about the private life of Charles Chaplin.

His influences on me in particular are deep and far reaching and I consider him to be the fishing father I never had. He said that for a common property resource to flourish it required stewardship from a dedicated body of anglers. I became involved in the early 1970s and nearly four decades later I continue volunteering my time on behalf of fish and their habitat. He influenced me in my choice of tackle, and of course he was the main influence that directed me into pursuing steelhead and other BC game fish with a fly. He awakened my interest in fly-fishing literature and my library reflects Haig-Brown&#39;s influence in so many ways, from my collection of Haig-Brown books, to many others that he suggests in some of his writings. He too awakened my appreciation for fine press books and my library with its select limited editions is a reflection of that influence. The first edition of Fly Patterns of British Columbia contained about 50 references to Roderick Haig-Brown and through those references, one can see how important he is to BCs fly-fishing history. This book is the right one to reprint and include the section on The Haig-Brown Centenary. Not only does it highlight Roderick Haig-Brown, the book contains all his flies and flies of his contemporary fly-fishing friends of the day, such as the ardent angler artist, Tommy Brayshaw; Haig-Brown&#39;s steelhead fly-fishing mentor, General Noel Money; and the famous Kamloops trout fly-fisherman, Bill Nation. It is through these pioneer fly-fishers that British Columbia enjoys such a rich fly-fishing heritage. __ Art Lingren, May 2008</p><p>A retired administrator with the Greater Vancouver Regional District, Art Lingren has lived all his life in Vancouver and spent 37 years of his professional life supplying water and collecting and treating wastewater for the Lower Mainland&#39;s member municipalities.

Napoleon, therefore, was not the first to make full use of the martial qualities of the Swiss and obtained Swiss agreement to expand the recruitment of regiments for service in the French Army. Napoleon would use Swiss troops on the battlefields of Italy and Spain, and in 1812 re-organize the four original regiments into a single division for the invasion of Russia, with each regiment having three full-strength battalions. In all theatres where they were engaged, Swiss contingents would often be relied upon to act as rearguards so other forces caught in a tight situation could escape. Time and again they would be asked to save the day for the French soldiers with whom they fought, in Italy and Spain and most famously for Napoleon himself, in Russia. In November of 1812, meeting up with Napoleon's main force retreating from Moscow at the Berezina River, the Swiss on the west bank guarded the approaches to the pontoon bridges from the Russian attack to the south. 1,200 Swiss, out of approximately 8,000 that entered Russia, were left to face, along with 8,000 men from other units, the 30,000-strong Russian army. The Swiss held their ground and when their ammunition ran out they charged the Russians with bayonets. </p><p>This book reveals the proud combat history of the Swiss troops of Napoleon's army as well as the colourful uniforms they wore.</p></p><p>David Greentree was born in Portsmouth in 1970.

It has responded, as Matt Kennard&#x2019;s explosive investigative report makes clear, by opening its doors to neo-Nazis, white supremacists, gang members, criminals of all stripes, the overweight, and the mentally ill. Based on several years of reporting, <i>Irregular Army </i>includes extensive interviews with extremist veterans and leaders of far-right hate groups&#x2014;who spoke openly of their eagerness to have their followers acquire military training for a coming domestic race war. As a report commissioned by the Department of Defense itself put it, &#x201c;Effectively, the military has a &#x2018;don&#x2019;t ask, don&#x2019;t tell&#x2019; policy pertaining to extremism.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Irregular Army</i> connects some of the War on Terror&#x2019;s worst crimes to this opening-up of the US military. With millions of veterans now back in the US and domestic extremism on the rise, Kennard&#x2019;s book is a stark warning about potential dangers facing Americans&#x2014;from their own soldiers.</p><p><b>Matt Kennard</b> is a journalist based in London.

The mystery is not <i>why</i> Haycock was murdered&#x2014;very few could stomach the woman-hating prof&#x2014;but <i>who</i> did the deed. <br>Estelle "Woody" Woodhaven, a private investigator hired to find the killer, naturally enlists the help of that indefatigable amateur sleuth, Kate Fansler. Together, they start to pull at the loose ends of the very tangled Clifton College English Department. The list of suspects is longer than the freshman survey reading list. And as the women defuse the host of literary landmines set out for them, Woody suspects they're only scratching the surface of a very large and sinister plot. . . .</p><p>Amanda Cross (nom de plume of Columbia University professor Carolyn Heilbrun) and her elegant academic detective, Kate Fansler, have long been considered the doyennes of the literary mystery. Murder, blackmail, and theft are the unsavory but intriguing cornerstones of their ivory towers, and Cross ruthlessly exposes the vagaries of university life, with its (admittedly stereotyped) pretentious professors and impenetrable literary tomes. But with a dozen Fansler mysteries under her belt, Cross is introducing a new force to the groves of academe. "Woody" Woodhaven is a former New York defense attorney who's decided she prefers the private investigator's life, with its independence and authority (and, as she readily admits, she's got a lot of weight to throw around). <p> Clifton College has hired Woody to find out who has "rushed Charles Haycock into shuffling off his mortal coil." A conceited old bigot whose love of Tennyson was matched only by his hatred of women, Professor Haycock took a sip of a cocktail that was equal parts retsina and digitalin. When the police receive a letter blaming one of Haycock's English department colleagues, the department decides to do its own sorting of skeletons and asks Woody to do a bit of surreptitious closet cleaning. Baffled by the abstruse jargon and petty territoriality of the suspects, Woody turns to Kate Fansler for help. Could Haycock's passion for Tennyson <i>really</i> have been a motive for murder? Are departmental politics just so much hot air and venom, or do they mask a killing agenda?</p><p> Woody is charming, funny, and sardonic, big and strong enough to carry the burden of a heavy plot. More is the pity, then, that <i>Honest Doubt</i> is a relative lightweight. Cross seems rather more interested in having Woody sing Kate's praises than in the niceties of motive and character construction. All due respect for the doughty Professor Fansler, but for a novel that makes so much of its heroine's ample girth, most readers will find themselves wishing for a bit more meat on the story's bones. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>"ONE OF CROSS'S BEST BOOKS IN YEARS."<br>--<i>The</i> <i>Providence Journal</i><b><br><br></b>"AS SHOCKING AS IT IS PLAUSIBLE."<br>--<i>The Washington Post Book World</i><br></p><h2>Knit Your Own Murder (A Needlecraft Mystery)</h2><p><b>In the <i>USA Today</i> bestselling Needlecraft Mysteries, Betsy Devonshire has her hands tied between running her needlework shop and turning her sharp eye for deduction to solving crimes...</b><br> &nbsp;<br>The Monday Bunch and other local knitters are participating in a fund-raising auction to save a community center, creating a growing pile of stuffed animals and toys right in front of the auctioneers as the audience bids.

Not so to the Indian tribes of the Old Northwest, who joined the British attempt to hold off the expansionist American armies in a desperate effort to retain their tribal lands, promised to them by the British in return for their alliance. The Indian force numbered some sixteen hundred warriors-Shawnees, Winnebagoes, Kickapoos, Potawatomis, Sacs, Ottawas, Muncey Delawares, Ojibwas, and Senecas among them.</p> <p>In September and October of 1813, after holding the frontier against the United States for more than a year, a small force of British and Indians under General Henry Procter and the Shawnee chief Tecumseh was driven from Amherstburg after the Battle of Lake Erie. They retreated to the River Thames. The succeeding engagement at Moraviantown, on October 5, 1813, was the most decisive American victory won on British soil in this war. The death of Tecumseh, who was killed while valiantly defending the field after the British had fled, cost the British-Indian alliance its most effective leader.</p> <p>The story of the campaign has never been fully told from the point of view of the Indians and the British, but innumerable legends have persisted about it, many of them contrasting the courage of the Shawnee chief with the alleged cowardice of Procter. In attempting to dispel the myths, John Sugden searched for surviving records in Britain, Canada, and the United States. He found a major source of information in the little-known minutes of General Procter's court-martial, filed in the Public Record Office at Kew, England.</p> <p>From this and many other sources, both published and unpublished, the author has comprehensively reconstructed the retreat and tackled the major questions: why was Procter compelled to withdraw from Amherstburg after the loss of his squadron on Lake Erie; why and how did Procter and Tecumseh fight at Moraviantown; how was Tecumseh killed; and how did the engagement affect the fortunes of the British, the Indians, and the Americans in the remaining months of the war.</p> <p>Sugden further enhances our knowledge about the great Chief Tecumseh in the definitive account of the circumstances surrounding his death.</p></p><p><p><strong>John Sugden</strong> is a native of Hull, England, and he received a doctorate in Modern History from the University of Sheffield. He is currently Joint Director of Studies at Hereward College in Coventry and is a contributor to academic journals in Britain and the United States. Sugden is especially interested in Indian resistance movements, and his article, "The Southern Indians in the War of 1812: The Closing Phase," was awarded the Arthur W. Thompson Memorial Prize in Florida History in 1982 and was judged the best article to appear in the <em>Florida Historical Quarterly </em>that year.</p>Sugden presents a detailed study of the most important campaign on the northwest frontier during the War of 1812, culminating in America's victory at the Battle of the Thames (Moraviantown), Canada, on October 5, 1813. He reevaluates the role of British General Henry Proctor, but concentrates on Britain's Indian ally, the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, who was killed in the battle. Sugden analyzes the details and controversies of Tecumseh's death. His work complements R. David Edmunds's biography, Tecumseh and the Quest for Indian Leadership (Little, 1984), and is best suited for special collections on Indian and military history. Joseph G.

They were well trained, confident, and had good reasons to hope that the war in the East would be over with one last offensive. Facing them was an equally large Soviet force, but whose soldiers were neither as well trained nor as confident. When the Germans struck, disaster soon befell the Soviet defenders. German panzer spearheads cut through enemy defenses and thrust deeply to encircle most of the Soviet soldiers on the approaches to Moscow. Within a few weeks, most of them marched into captivity, where a grim fate awaited them. <br><br>Despite the overwhelming initial German success, however, the Soviet capital did not fall. German combat units as well as supply transport were bogged down in mud caused by autumn rains. General Zhukov was called back to Moscow and given the desperate task to recreate defense lines west of Moscow. The mud allowed him time to accomplish this, and when the Germans again began to attack in November, they met stiffer resistance. Even so, they came perilously close to the capital, and if the vicissitudes of weather had cooperated, would have seized it. Though German units were also fighting desperately by now, the Soviet build-up soon exceeded their own.<br><br>THE DRIVE ON MOSCOW: Operation Taifun, 1941 is based on numerous archival records, personal diaries, letters, and other sources. It recreates the battle from the perspective of the soldiers as well as the generals.

Poor Puppy, Bruel writes. Poor, poor Puppy. Poor, poor, poor, poor, <i>poor </i>Puppy! The book then becomes a counting/alphabet book to demonstrate that Puppy isn't really poor&#x2014;in fact he has many playthings at his disposal: 1 Airplane, 2 Balls, 3 Cars and so on. But Puppy still wants to play with Kitty, and as he falls asleep, the book takes another trip through the alphabet&#x2014;and through the world&#x2014;as Puppy dreams of 26 fun activities and locales he'd like to share with his best friend Kitty: Apple Bobbing in Antarctica, Baseball in Brazil, Checkers in Canada, etc. Unfortunately, Bruel's usually sharp sense of humor is not as evident in this sequel. The alphabet-driven catalogues of <i>Bad Kitty</i> were funny because they pushed the boundaries of probability when it came to Kitty's sociopathic tendencies, her favorite foods and her equally hyperbolic acts of redemption. But despite Bruel's colorful visual treatment of the physical activity here, the vignettes often feel inert. Even the wittiest moments&#x2014;such as Puppy and Kitty playing Patty-cake in Peru&#x2014;may generate fewer laughs than Kitty's previous comedic nefariousness. <i>Bad Kitty </i>fans will want to take note of a new cat-nipped edition of that title (with a pair of large bite marks, courtesy of Kitty), due out the same month.

Her husband, Joe Wolf Mantooth, is holding things together, caring for their son, Michael, and dealing with a visit from his long-estranged father, Sly Mantooth. Faye spends her time aimlessly digging holes on Joyeuse Island, her home off the Florida coast, until one day she digs into an old tank that's releasing some noxious fluid. When the crew from the EPA arrives, they find elevated amounts of arsenic in the soil. On the mainland, Faye's friend Liz Colton has been murdered and a local boat mechanic caught dumping noxious substances in the water. Faye's been trying to avoid Oscar Croft, a wealthy Ohio native convinced that his Civil War officer ancestor was held prisoner nearby by a crazy woman who sent his sword home to his wife. Working for Oscar is Delia Scarsdale, an attractive genealogist determined to track down information on Cally Stanton. Faye's unwilling to admit that Cally is her great-great-grandmother, a former slave who owned Joyeuse and left an unpublished memoir mentioning the Civil War officer. Could the murder, the contamination, and the search for information about the past all be related? Faye, who feels compelled to look for answers, puts her whole family in grave danger, but what she finds turns out to be her salvation. A worthwhile addition to Faye's long-running series (Rituals, 2013, etc.) that weaves history, mystery, and psychology into a satisfying tale of greed and passion.

This new installment in the Rowan of Rin series will not disappoint fantasy-adventure fans. When Rowan keeps quiet about his premonition of disaster and his younger sister, Annad, is kidnapped and whisked away to the land of the Zebak by a fanged, flying grach, Rowan feels responsible. He decides to attempt a rescue. After receiving a mysterious packet and a set of instructions in the form of a riddle from Sheba, the community witch, he sets off, accompanied by Perlain, one of the fishlike Maris creatures; Zeel, a Zebak who has been raised by Travelers; and Allun, a resident of Rin with a Traveler father. His comrades become essential to the quest. As in previous books in the series, Rowan's adventures are riveting, with plot twists sufficient to keep the outcome in doubt until the final pages. Rodda's alien landscapes and imaginative creatures will intrigue young audiences, but it's the characters, who seem fully human, that are the strength of the book. On a subtler level Rodda says much about the importance of recognizing and celebrating an individual's strengths. This book easily stands alone, but since the others in the series are so good, why not enjoy them all? <i>Kay Weisman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Whence the weirdness and alleged criminality? How to account for Michael Jackson&#x2019;s rise and fall? In <i>On Michael Jackson</i>&#x2014;an at once passionate, incisive, and bracing work of cultural analysis&#x2014;Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning critic for <i>The New York Times Margo Jefferson</i> brilliantly unravels the complexities of one of the most enigmatic figures of our time.<br><br>Who is Michael Jackson and what does it mean to call him a &#x201c;What Is It&#x201d;? What do P. T. Barnum, Peter Pan, and Edgar Allan Poe have to do with our fascination with Jackson? How did his curious Victorian upbringing and his tenure as a child prodigy on the &#x201c;chitlin&#x2019; circuit&#x201d; inform his character and multiplicity of selves? How is Michael Jackson&#x2019;s celebrity related to the outrageous popularity of nineteenth-century minstrelsy? What is the perverse appeal of child stars for grown-ups and what is the price of such stardom for these children and for us? What uncanniness provoked Michael Jackson to become &#x201c;Alone of All His Race, Alone of All Her Sex,&#x201d; while establishing himself as an undeniably great performer with neo-Gothic, dandy proclivities and a producer of visionary music videos? What do we find so unnerving about Michael Jackson&#x2019;s presumed monstrosity? In short, how are we all of us implicated?<br><br>In her stunning first book, Margo Jefferson gives us the incontrovertible lowdown on call-him-what-you-wish; she offers a powerful reckoning with a quintessential, richly allusive signifier of American society and popular culture.</p><p><b>Book Description</b><br> Margo Jefferson&#x2019;s <i>On Michael Jackson</i> is a lucid and elegant cultural analysis of the rise and fall of the King of Pop.<br> <p>An award-winning cultural critic, Jefferson brings an unexpected compassion as well as her sharp intellect and incomparable insight to Jackson&#x2019;s 2005 trial for child molestation, startling us with her erudite illumination of a media-drenched circus that we only thought we understood. As only she can, Jefferson reads between the lines of Jackson&#x2019;s 1998 autobiography as well as published accounts of his childhood, his family, and Motown--where Michael and his brothers first made the Jackson 5 a household name--leaving us with provocative and perhaps unanswerable questions about Jackson, child stardom, and fame itself.</p> <br><strong>Margo Jefferson on the Life and Death of Michael Jackson</strong><br> Pundits love to talk about the crises and cultural flashpoints that give Americans the chance to grow up and think outside of the usual dualities: this is good, that is evil; we hate her, we love him. Michael Jackson&#x2019;s death gives us yet another chance. <br> <p>Talent, scandal, sudden death, and a 24/7 media cycle make us very worshipful or very cynical. We can do better this time around. We don&#x2019;t have to sneer or be pious. We know Michael Jackson was a genius, and we know he became a tortured soul. The first three days after his death were our grace period. We watched videos, replayed our favorite songs relived our youth, and waxed nostalgia about the good old days when all we had to deal with was his enormous talent. And though I never much liked the song, "we" were definitely the world--crowding onto streets, into theaters and parks, dancing (or at least swaying) to his music. North and South America. Europe. Africa. Asia. Only Antarctica and most of the animal kingdom stayed uninvolved. </p> <p>Then the nasty stuff started creeping out again, like the ghouls in <i>Thriller</i>. Drug reports, rumors of custody wars, tours of an empty Neverland, memorial extravaganza plans; the sight of Michael&#x2019;s father hustling family unity along with his new record company; the statements and counter-statements of siblings, lawyers, ex-employees, companions and bottom-feeders. And, of course, the three children. Whatever we don&#x2019;t know about them, we do know they&#x2019;re worth their weight in gold records and posthumous business deals. And it&#x2019;s only just begun. </p> <p>But we can live with the damaged life and the great work: both of them, all at once. We have to. So much of Michael Jackson&#x2019;s damage reflects the worst in our culture, and so much of his talent reflects the best.<i>--Margo Jefferson</i></p> <p>(Photo � Brent Murray)</p><b>Margo Jefferson</b> has written for <i>The New York Times</i> since 1993 and received the Pulitzer Prize in 1995.

I saw their leaders on TV. Strong, articulate faces. So when Cavanaugh phoned and invited me to join a men's club, I laughed. Slowly, not laughing, he repeated himself. He was six foot nine. The size and weight entered his voice. He and some friends wanted a club. "A regular social possibility outside of our jobs and marriages. Nothing to do with women's groups." One man was a tax accountant, another was a lawyer. There was also a college teacher like me and two psychotherapists. Solid types. I supposed there could be virtues in a men's club, a regular socialpossibility. I should have said yes immediately, but something in me resisted. The prospect of leaving my house after dinner to go to a meeting. Blood is heavy then. Brain is slow. Besides, wasn't this club idea corny? Like trying to recapture high-school days. Locker-room fun. Wet naked boys snapping towels at each other's genitals. It didn't feel exactly right. To be wretchedly truthful, any social possibility unrelated to wife, kids, house, and work felt like a form of adultery. Not criminal. Not legitimate."Cavanaugh, I don't even go to the movies anymore.""I'm talking about a men's club. Good company. You talk about women's groups. Movies. Can't you hear me?""When the phone rings, it's like an attack on my life. I get confused. Say it again.""Listen to me, man. You're one of my best friends. You live less than a mile away, but do we see each other three times a year? When is the last time we talked to each other, really talked?""I lose over a month a year just working to pay property taxes. Friendship is a luxury. Unless you're so poor it makes no difference how you spend your time.""A men's club. Good company.""I hear you."But I was thinking about good company. Some of my married colleagues had love affairs, usually with students. You could call it a regular social possibility. It included emotional chaos. Gonorrhea. Even guilt. They would have been better off in a men's club."What do you say? Can we expect you?""I'll go to the first meeting. I can't promise more. I'm very busy.""Yeah, yeah," said Cavanaugh and gave me an address in the Berkeley flats. A man named Harry Kramer lived there. I was to look for a redwood fence and pine trees.&nbsp;<br>The night of the meeting I told my wife I'd be home early. Before midnight, certainly. I had to teach the next day. She said, "Take out the garbage." Big sticky bag felt unpropitious and my hands soon smelled of tuna fish. After driving only five minutes, I found the place.The front of the house, vine-covered, seemed to brood in lunatic privacy. Nobody answered when I knocked, but I heard voices, took hold of a wroughtiron handle and pushed, discovering a large Berkeley living room and five men inside. I saw dark wood paneling and potted ferns dangling from exposed beams. Other plants along the window ledges. A pottedtree in a far corner, skinny, spinsterish-looking. Nervous yellow leaves filled its head. Various ceramics, bowls on tabletops and plates on the walls beside large acrylic paintings, abstractions like glistening viscera splashed off a butcher block. Also an amazing rug, but I couldn't take it in. A man was rising from a pillow, coming toward me, smiling."I knocked," I said."Come in, man. I'm Harry Kramer.""I'm Cavanaugh's friend.""Who isn't?""Really," I said, giving it the L.A. inflection to suggest sympathetic understanding, not wonder. Kramer registered the nuance and glanced at me as at a potential brother.His heavy black hair was controlled by a style, parted in the middle and shaped to cup his ears in a way that once belonged to little girls. It was contradicted by black force in his eyes, handshake like a bite, and tattooed forearms. Blue, winged snake. Blue dagger amid roses. They spoke for an earlier life, I supposed, but Kramer wore his sleeves rolled to the elbow. It was hard to connect him with his rug, which I began to appreciate as spongy and orange. I felt myself wading and bouncing through it as Kramer led me toward the men.Shaking hands, nodding hello, saying my name, each man was a complex flash--eyes, hand, name --but one had definition. He was graphic; instantly closer to me than the others. Solly Berliner. Tall, skinny, wearing a suit. Dead-white hair and big greenish light in his eyes. The face of an infant surprised by senility. His suit was gray polyester, conservative and sleazy. Kramer left me with Berliner beside the potted tree, a beer in my hand. A man about five foot six or seven came right up to us. "Care for a taste?" In his palm lay two brown marijuanas, slick with spittle. I declined. Berliner said, "Thanks, thanks," with frightening gratitude, and took both cigarettes. We laughed. Then he dropped one back into the man's palm. Turning toward the others, the man said, "Anyone care for a taste?"The sound of Berliner's voice lingered after the joke; loud, impulsive. Maybe he felt uneasy. Out of his natural environment. I couldn't guess where that might be. He was a confusion of clues. The suit wasn't Berkeley. The eyes were worlds of feeling. His speedy voice flew from nerves. Maybe the living room affected him. A men's club would have seemed more authentic, more properly convened, elsewhere. What did I have in mind? A cold ditch? I supposed Kramer's wife, exiled for the evening, had cultivatedthe plants and picked the orange rug and the luscious fabrics on the couches and chairs. Ideas of happiness. Berliner and I remained standing, as if the fabrics--heavy velvets, beige tones--were nothing to violate with our behinds. It was a woman's living room, but so what? The point of the club was to be with men, not to worry about women. I turned to Berliner and asked what he did for a living."Real estate," he said, grinning ferociously, as if. extreme types were into that. Wild fellows. "I drove in from San Jose." He spoke with rapid little shrugs, as if readjusting his vertebrae. His eyes, after two drags on the cigarette, were full of green distance. He was already driving back to San Jose, I figured. Then he said, "Forgive me for saying this, but a minute ago, when Kramer introduced us, I had a weird thought.""You did?"His eyes returned to me with a look I'd seen before. It signaled the California plunge into truth."I hope this doesn't bother you. I thought ..."I waited."Oh, forget it, man.""No, please go on. What did you think?""I thought you had a withered leg.""You did?""Yeah, but I see you don't. Isn't that weird?""Weird that I don't have a withered leg?""Yeah, I thought your leg was all screwed up. Like withered."I wiggled my legs. For my sake, not his. He stared as if into unusual depths and seemed, regardless of my wiggling, not convinced. Then he said, "I'm forty-seven.""You look much younger." This was true. But, with the white hair, he also looked older."I stay in shape," he answered, marijuana smoke leaking from his nostrils. "Nobody," he said, sucking the leak back against crackling sheets of snot, "nobody else in the room is forty-seven. I'm oldest. I asked the guys."He gagged, then released smoke, knifing it through compressed lips. "Kramer is thirty-eight."I wondered if conversation had ever been more like medical experience, so rich in gas and mucus. "I'm always the oldest. Ever since I was a kid I was the oldest." He giggled and intensified his stare, waiting for me to confess something, too. I giggled back at him in a social way. Then the door opened and Cavanaugh walked in."Excuse me," I said, intimating regret but moving quickly away.My friend Cavanaugh--big, handsome guy--hadheroic charisma. He'd been a professional basketball player. Now he worked at the university in special undergraduate programs, matters of policy and funding. Nine to five, jacket and tie. To remember his former work--the great naked shoulders and legs flying through the air--was saddening. In restaurants and airports people still asked for his autograph.Things felt better, more natural, healthier, with the big man in the room. Kramer reached him before I did. They slapped each other's arms, laughing, pleased at how they felt to each other. Solid. Real. I watched, thinking I'd often watched Cavanaugh. Ever since college, in fact, when he'd become famous. To see him burn his opponent and score was like a miracle of justice. In civilian clothes, he was faintly disorienting. Especially his wristwatch, a golden, complicated band. Symbolic manacle. Cavanaugh's submission to ordinary life. He didn't burn anybody. He'd once said, "I don't want my kids to grow up like me, necks thicker than their heads." He wanted his kids in jackets and wristwatches.He stopped slapping Kramer's arms, but Kramer continued touching him and looked as though he might soon pee in his pants. People love athletes. Where else these days do they see such mythic drama? Images of unimpeachable excellence. I was infected byKramer's enthusiasm, a bit giddy now at the sight of Cavanaugh. When Kramer left to get him a beer, we shook hands. He said, "I didn't think I'd see you tonight." There was mockery in his smile."It's not so easy getting out of the house. Nobody but you could have dragged me to this.""You open the door, you're out.""Tell me about it.""I'm glad you're here. Anything happen yet? I'm a little late because Sarah thinks the club idea is wrong. I'm wrong to be here. We argued at dinner." He whispered, "Maybe it isn't easy," and looked at his wristwatch, frowning, as if it were his mind. Kramer returned with the beer just as a phone started ringing.</p><h2>Hubener vs. Hitler: A Biography of Helmuth Hubener, Mormon Teenage Resistance Leader</h2><p><p>From Nazi Germany came one of the most intriguing, gut-wrenching events of the century, when a group of teenage Germans waged their own war against Adolf Hitler.</p> <p>Master biographer Richard Lloyd Dewey recounts the compelling true story of Helmuth Hubener - the brilliant and bold teenager who daringly formed the youngest resistance group to face the Nazis.</p> <p>Learn how young Hubener recruited others, how his group eluded the SS, played cat-and-mouse with the Gestapo, and, amazingly, outsmarted all the Nazi authorities who sought to hunt them down.</p> <p>This is a mesmerizing account of the entire group and its operations, and how they exposed the Third Reich, which thought hundreds of British agents were involved when they were actually just a band of determined German teenagers.

The story was totally captivating. I love the way we started by meeting Dora, and were given just enough information about her to grow to like her and then she&#x2019;s taken away from us. I guess that&#x2019;s kind of how her life was. The reader feels just like the people of Dodge City must have felt, to lose her so early and tragically.&nbsp; Then we meet the posse.

Graduate work at the University of Chicago in criminology introduced him to the Capone gang, and later to Joliet State Prison, where he studied prison life. He founded what is known today as the Alinsky ideology and Alinsky concepts of mass organization for power. His work in organizing the poor to fight for their rights as citizens has been internationally recognized. In the late 1930s he organized the Back of the Yards area in Chicago (the neighborhood made famous in Upton Sinclair&#39;s The Jungle). Subsequently, through the Industrial Areas Foundation which he began in 1940, Mr. Alinsky and his staff helped to organize communities not only in Chicago but throughout the country. He later turned his attentions to the middle class, creating a training institute for organizers.

And some are ridiculous, like Batty&#x2019;s new dog-walking business. Batty is saving up her dog-walking money for an extra-special surprise for her family, which she plans to present on her upcoming birthday. But when some unwelcome surprises make themselves known, the best-laid plans fall apart.<br> &nbsp;<br> Filled with all the heart, hilarity, and charm that has come to define this beloved clan, <i>The Penderwicks in Spring</i> is about fun and family and friends (and dogs), and what happens when you bring what's hidden into the bright light of the spring sun.<br></p><p>When Jeanne Birdsall was young, she promised herself she&#x2019;d be a writer someday&#x2014;so that she could write books for children to discover and enjoy, just as she did at her local library. She is the author of <i>The Penderwicks,</i> which won the National Book Award for Young People&#x2019;s Literature, <i>The Penderwicks on Gardam Street,</i> and <i>The Penderwicks at Point Mouette.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Jeanne lives in Northampton, Massachusetts, with her husband and an assortment of animals, including a dog named Cagney. You can find out more about Jeanne, her books, and her animal friends at JeanneBirdsall.com.Gr 4&#x2013;7&#x2014;The Penderwick family is back in the fourth book of Birdsall's popular series. With the addition of younger sister Lydia and the recent death of beloved dog Hound, the cast of characters has changed a bit. Though told from the perspectives of Batty and Ben&#x2014;the younger brother added to the clan in The Penderwicks on Gardam Street (Knopf, 2008)&#x2014;this is truly Batty's story. Rosalind is in college, and Skye and Jane are both in high school. In this volume, Batty discovers that she has a talent for singing, which she keeps a secret from the rest of her family so that she can plan a Grand Birthday Concert. Jeffrey, their family friend, will be visiting for Skye's birthday, and Batty wants to ask him to be her mentore. She also takes on a job walking dogs to pay for voice lessons. She's conflicted about this because she believes that it was her fault that Hound died and she doesn't want to "curse" any more dogs. Fans of the series may find the time jump jarring&#x2014;Batty, who was only four during the first book, is now 10&#x2014;and the lack of OPS (Older Penderwick Sisters) dismaying. Throughout the series, Birdsall has demonstrated considerable skill at crafting a modern classic, merging modern-day wit with an old-fashioned charm. Birdsall is a master at making the everyday exciting.

Its simple profundity is recognized today in every corner of the world: "The Tao which can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name which can be named is not the eternal name." <p>So it begins and moves gracefully through the various paradoxes of existence, harmonizing light and shadow. It is difficult for a modern reader to approach this text without wondering about the life and times of the man who wrote it. </p><p>Lao-Tse (or Lao-Tzu, as it is sometime spelled) was a name, and little more; the details of his life have been lost to history. Only the work survived...until now. Mystics of all times and places have taught that every event that has occurred is forever recorded in the annals of time. An associate of Abd-ru-shin, author of the spiritual classic In the Light of Truth: The Grail Message, has made a spiritual connection to that ageless record and here reports what it reveals about the life of the sage called Lao-Tse. </p><p>There is no indication of author in this, or any other book in Grail Foundation Press' Forerunner Series. Those who made the connection were able to see truly, and to write down what they saw, but they do not consider themselves authors of the volumes. For this reason, the books appear with the simple notation, "Received in the proximity of Abd-ru-shin through the special gift of one Called for the purpose." </p><p>The text follows chronologically through the life of Lao-Tse in a style that reveals the sage as simultaneously human and transcendent. Some of the most touching passages tell of Lao-Tse's childhood and the reactions he inspired in his often-confused parents: "Li-Fu-Tai lived in the constant expectation of discovering his ancestor in his son. At the very least, this boy was bound to be completely different from all other sons of men. He watched the child constantly, but at the same time he suffered many a disappointment. [The boy] developed exactly like other healthy children. In time he learned to walk and talk, he fell into the water and reached a fire. When he got into some childhood mischief, the father was annoyed by his son's naughtiness. But his mother tempered the punishments and softened the rebukes...To her all the child's actions...seemed to spring from the same source; an immense thirst for knowledge...He asked few question, preferring to find his answers through experiencing." </p><p>There's an immediacy in this prose, as the author who does not claim authorship transports us back through time, to witness the emergence of one of the greatest sages ever to live. This book is inspiring and compelling--worth the reading for anyone who cares about humankind's spiritual legacy.</p></p><p>In every culture heralds of Truth have appeared at times of critical development in order to help people on their spiritual path. The lives and work of many of these Truth-bringers is described in the Forerunner Book Series. The series came into being in the early 1930's in connection with In the Light of Truth: The Grail Message and its author, Abd-ru-shin (Oskar Ernst Bernhardt, 1875-1941). Among those associated with him, there were a few who, in his proximity, gained an insight into spiritual connections in historical events. They wrote down what they beheld, but did not consider themselves the authors of the volumes. For this reason, the books appeared and still appear without indication of author, and with the notation, "Received in the proximity of Abd-ru-shin through the special gift of one Called for the purpose." The Forerunner books do not present fanciful pictures of the past. Rather, they describe historical happenings in their imperishable form. Everything that has taken place is recorded in the annals of time, so that we of today may develop our perceptions from those events. What becomes apparent is that in the course of millennia mankind was repeatedly shown ways to find the Truth. But instead of accepting the Truth, people adapted It toward earthly objectives and deflected that which did not fit in with their personal world view. Had it been otherwise, writes Abd-ru-shin: <p>"...there would now be only one uniform teaching here on earth, issuing from the Will of God. There would not be so many kinds of denominations. All the teachings that have come to the earth in the past would, united, form a single flight of steps to the pedestal on which the Truth is to stand... There would be no differences in the interpretations, much less differences in the teachings themselves!--For all teachings were at one time willed by God, precisely adapted to the individual peoples and countries, and formed in complete accord with their actual spiritual maturity and receptivity... The bringers of all the individual teachings were Forerunners of the Word of Truth Itself..." The struggle between value systems and religions would be impossible if only the simple recognition that all religious wisdom, every proclamation of Truth came from one source. The Forerunner Book Series can (and should) pave a way for this recognition in that it depicts the Truth-bringers of past eras, their lives and their teachings, free of every-thing the human mind has concealed in the past. The complete Forerunner Series of nine books (see listing at the beginning of this volume) includes five monographs about: </p><p>Ephesus (Hjalfdar in prehistoric times) </p><p>Zoroaster (Zarathustra) in Iran </p><p>Lao-Tse in China (this volume) </p><p>Buddha in India, and </p><p>Mohammed in Arabia</p>This volume describes the life and work of the sage Lao-Tse in ancient China. His youth, his maturing, and his inner struggles in coming to terms with the religious concepts of his times are described to the reader in vivid pictures. Lao-Tse learns that through his inner conviction he can dispel the influence of "evil forces," reducing them to nothing. He trusts in the Power of one Creator, God, a belief he proclaims on his travel throughout China. <p>Lao-Tse achieves great renown with his teaching and is elevated to the position of advisor to the emperor. After many years of fruitful activity with him, opposing powers once more gain influence. But the Truth, for which he helped prepare the way, is undying.</p></p><h2>The Surgeon&#39;s Lady</h2><p><br><br>As a surgeon in the Royal Navy, Lieutenant Philemon Brittle has proved his bravery countless times.

Anne Perry lives in Scotland and Los Angeles.Vespasia stood at the long, open window of her hotel bedroom and gazed across the rooftops of the city toward the western sky. The sun was sinking into <br><br>the Mediterranean, as if it were bleeding crimson into the water. The light was fading quickly. The air was already cooler, but it was mid-�December. Even here in Jaffa, on the coast of Palestine, the winters were cold.<br><br>Still smiling, she pulled her shawl around her shoulders. This journey to Jerusalem was the most cherished Christmas gift she had ever been given. She knew all the great cities of Europe, but she had never come farther east. Was it her imagination that this land was so very different from the places she knew? How much is any place seen through the lens of one&#x2019;s imagination, colored by the dreams one has of it and of the events that have happened there?<br><br>In Paris, does one hear the laughter and music, and see the ghosts of the Revolution and the Terror? In Rome, does the tramp of the legions sound on the stones? Does one see Caesar with the laurels on his brow, and the world at his feet?<br><br>Who does one see in this land, holy to Muslim, Jew, and Christian alike?<br><br>She should close the window and go in, keep the room warm. And yet she wanted to watch the sky darken until there was only the blaze of stars to see.<br><br>Vespasia had known Victor Narraway for many years in connection with Thomas Pitt and the cases he had solved, and in which they had assisted one way or another, but in spite of her silver hair and the refinement of many years in her face, this year of 1900 was only the second of their marriage. Narraway&#x2019;s gift of a journey to Jerusalem had surprised her. There was a spiritual resonance to it she would not have expected from him. She knew his ethical beliefs very well. She could not have married a man whose driving forces she did not know, but he had never framed them in terms of religion. But then perhaps she had not either. One could kneel in church among scores of people who used the same words as you did, many long familiar, and yet the meanings they each took from them were probably worlds apart.<br><br>There was so much to discover, even in those you knew best. She hoped it would always be so. One should be growing, changing, learning forever. Ideas in the mind were like blood in the veins. The heart that does not beat is dying.<br><br>She heard movement behind her and turned.<br><br>Narraway was standing in the middle of the room, smiling. In the soft candlelight he looked very dark, and the usual lines of anxiety were eased away, as if he had left all responsibilities behind.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get cold,&#x201d; he warned her.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I know,&#x201d; she admitted. &#x201c;I was waiting for the stars.&#x201d; She pulled the windows closed and fastened the lock. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too early for dinner. If I take a cloak, we could go for a walk. Perhaps toward the sea? It&#x2019;s only half a mile or so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said a trifle too quickly. &#x201c;It would be unwise to walk in the streets after dark.&#x201d; A flicker of concern crossed his face. &#x201c;In fact, it might be better not to go toward the dockside even in daylight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know there&#x2019;s unrest,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;But isn&#x2019;t that a little . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, it isn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he answered, his face somber. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s always unease in Palestine, but this time of the year it&#x2019;s worse. Thousands of Christian pilgrims come here on their way to Jerusalem, or Bethlehem. Jews come to the Western Wall, and Muslims to the Dome of the Rock. Feelings are high.&#x201d; He gave a slight shrug, just the lifting of one shoulder. &#x201c;God knows, too often we have little respect for one another&#x2019;s religions or customs, especially if they conflict with our own, and we don&#x2019;t understand them. We don&#x2019;t even try to.&#x201d;<br><br>She heard the sharpness in his voice, and might have mistaken it for temper had she not known the depth of his knowledge. In all the experiences they had shared, very often in connection with matters of importance and danger, she had never seen his nerve fail him. Once he had been head of Special Branch, that arm of the police service responsible for the detection of treason and threats to the safety of the state from within, as opposed to those who defend from armed attack by other nations. In all her long and frequently interesting life, Vespasia had never known anyone less likely to fear unreasonably.<br><br>He offered her his arm. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll walk in the garden. It&#x2019;s small, but it&#x2019;s very pleasant, even at this time of the year.&#x201d;<br><br>At the door, he put her cloak around her and she felt his touch linger a moment longer than necessary. The pressure of his fingers was light, but she was aware of its warmth, and it pleased her.<br><br>The garden was indeed small, little more than a wide-�open courtyard with a few vines on the supporting pillars of the extended roof. A couple of cypress trees rose like black flames beside the fountain, which flowed with slight sound into the stone pool. The four hanging lanterns were too dim to detract from the blaze of stars across the open center.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s hardly room to walk,&#x201d; he said with regret. &#x201c;But at least there&#x2019;s no one here to disturb.&#x201d; The moment he said it, she saw that he was mistaken. A shadow detached itself from one of the farther pillars, was visible for a moment, then melted into the hollow of the arcade and disappeared. She felt his hand tighten on her arm, and she stopped.<br><br>&#x201c;Possibly a servant,&#x201d; she said quietly. It was ridiculous to be distressed by it.<br><br>&#x201c;Or someone keeping an assignation,&#x201d; Narraway suggested, beginning to move again.<br><br>Vespasia looked upward at the sweep of stars, now that the darker sky made them brilliant. &#x201c;I imagine they&#x2019;ll be even better out in the desert, when we take the train to Jerusalem. The stars seem so much farther away in London; here they look almost close enough to touch&#x2014;�just stretch a little more, stand on tiptoe. I wonder if that is why Christ was born in a place like this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For the stars?&#x201d; he said with disbelief.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, the wise men could hardly follow the star on a winter night in London,&#x201d; she said reasonably.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you believe that, about the star?&#x201d; he asked with interest, and perhaps a shadow of amusement. He was standing a little behind her, close enough to keep the faint breeze from chilling her. &#x201c;If they could see it, why couldn&#x2019;t everyone else? Why couldn&#x2019;t Herod, for a start? Didn&#x2019;t he ask them where it led, and to come back and tell him?&#x201d;<br><br>She was silent for a moment. She had not considered it before. Indeed, why had the frightened, jealous Herod not seen the star himself? Why did he need the wise men to return and tell him where it had guided them?<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she said at last. &#x201c;Perhaps you only recognize what you are looking for.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But he was looking for it,&#x201d; Narraway pointed out.<br><br>She thought for a moment longer. &#x201c;He was looking for a rival king, in order to kill him while he was still an infant. The wise men were looking for a different kind of king, one to whom they brought gifts, symbolic of who he was.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; His voice lifted with mild curiosity.<br><br>&#x201c;Gold for the king, frankincense for the priest, and myrrh for the sacrifice,&#x201d; she told him.<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know that was what they meant,&#x201d; he admitted. &#x201c;Do you want to walk out into the next courtyard? It goes beyond the archway there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What a good idea,&#x201d; she agreed. &#x201c;Then in to dinner.&#x201d;<br><br>)<br><br>They were still early for the meal, and found themselves in a very pleasant lounge, where they asked if they might join an elderly man who was sitting alone near the fire. His hair was white, and his high-�browed aquiline face was weathered by wind and sun, and&#x2014;�Vespasia guessed&#x2014;�by much thought. The lines in it were etched deeply, and yet they only added to the beauty of his repose.<br><br>Narraway introduced himself and Vespasia, and they took the offered seats near him. The man spoke of his occupation as an astronomer, but he did not offer them his name.<br><br>&#x201c;You are English,&#x201d; he said with a smile. &#x201c;Much traveled, perhaps, but I think this is your first time in this land, whatever name you choose to give it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Narraway agreed. &#x201c;And you?&#x201d;<br><br>The man smiled. &#x201c;I confess, I travel so much I sometimes forget where I began. The world is full of interest, and beauty. The span of one life offers barely a taste of it: just sufficient to know that it is infinitely precious. Are you perhaps journeying to Jerusalem for Christmas?&#x201d; His eyes were bright, and he regarded them carefully. &#x201c;And yet you do not look like pilgrims, in the ordinary sense.&#x201d; He smiled, to rob his words of presumption. There was great gentleness in his face, and also perhaps a shadow, as if he saw, even at this moment, some of the darker things one does not easily mention to strangers.<br><br>&#x201c;Our visit is a Christmas gift,&#x201d; Vespasia told him. &#x201c;Do you know the country well?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very,&#x201d; the man replied. &#x201c;I shall go to Jerusalem again this year, for Christmas.&#x201d; He hesitated. &#x201c;I think.&#x201d; The shadow was in his eyes again. <br><br>For a moment, Vespasia&#x2019;s gaze was drawn to a small movement near the door, as if someone had pushed the door to the lounge open but gone away again without coming in. Then she looked back at the man.<br><br>&#x201c;You go often?&#x201d; she asked, smiling. <br><br>The man also smiled, as if filled with many memories. It was a sweet expression. &#x201c;Very,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;But whilst you are here, there are other cities you must see as well. Petra, for example. You approach it on horseback, through a great defile in the cliffs, and suddenly there it is in front of you, rose red, as if it were not man-�made, but has grown up out of the rich, burning rock around it.&#x201d;<br><br>He was traveling in a vision of his own, and neither Vespasia nor Narraway interrupted him.<br><br>&#x201c;Or Persepolis,&#x201d; he went on. &#x201c;You stand there in the evening light, like this, as if you were a traveler in time. The ruins of empires tower slender and exquisite into the sky, and you hear the camel bells as the caravans pass, eternally journeying through time, exactly as they were a thousand years ago, or two thousand, or five. Abraham could have paid his tithes to Melchizedek, and fled on his way into Egypt just so.&#x201d; He looked at Narraway. &#x201c;To step aside from the forward flow of time every now and again is a good thing. As long, of course, as you do not forget to return to the present. There is much to do, battles to be fought, wounds to heal. But from the look in your eyes, perhaps you know that?&#x201d;<br><br>Narraway smiled back at him. &#x201c;Not in what remains of this year. We are on holiday. It is the first real one we have had together. Events have always intruded before. Perhaps we stayed too close to home.&#x201d; There was a touch of regret in his voice, and Vespasia heard it. She would have reached out to touch him, had they been alone.<br><br>The old man&#x2019;s face was wistful. &#x201c;My dear friend, Jerusalem is the heart&#x2019;s home to all of us, and there is no escaping it.&#x201d;<br><br>Once again Vespasia, facing the doorway more than the others, was aware of a shadow beyond. The moment was so fleeting the shadow could almost have been an illusion, except for the breath of coldness it sent through her. They were being watched by someone who did not wish to be seen.<br><br>She forced the thought from her mind and joined in the conversation about travel until they were called to dinner. Without hesitation she invited the old man to join them, and he accepted with evident pleasure.<br><br>The food was simple but delicious, a delicately flavored whitefish, with only the lightest sauce, and a grain she had not tasted before, flavored with herbs. There was also a light dessert, a delicate pastry filled with fresh fruit. However, the chief pleasure was the conversation. They spoke of cities and of people. The old man had visited places that neither Vespasia nor Narraway had seen. He described Isfahan.<br><br>&#x201c;I remember standing on the cool sand in the night,&#x201d; he said quietly. &#x201c;The ancient minarets towered up into a sky almost white with stars, and there was not even a whisper of the wind. Then I heard the camels, and they appeared out of the darkness, piled high with who knows what? Silks, spices, ivory, gold. They came toward me with that strange, lurching gait that they have, at once so awkward, and yet so graceful, and there was no sound in the night except the bells. I thought of the old Silk Road, of Samarkand, and also Trebizond, and other places with marvelous names.&#x201d;<br><br>Narraway spoke a little of Bruges, and Saint Petersburg, and other cities built on canals. But even more they spoke of ideas. Some things were remembered with laughter, some with sadness, all were unique.<br><br>&#x201c;Such dreams,&#x201d; the old man said gently. &#x201c;As if we could climb high enough to reach the stars in heaven.&#x201d;<br><br>Again Vespasia saw, in the corner of her vision, the shadow pass the doorway and disappear. It was without the shading of fabric or the form of a man, the catching of the light on a shoulder or the curve of a head or face.<br><br>&#x201c;Someone is watching us,&#x201d; she said in a low voice, leaning closer to the old gentleman, thinking he may know who it was. Then, instantly, she thought how foolish it sounded.<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; the old man agreed quietly with a sudden bleakness in his face. &#x201c;I think the time is close. Perhaps tonight, or tomorrow.&#x201d; He looked up to address them both. &#x201c;Share this bottle of wine with me, in the name of companionship.&#x201d;<br><br>Vespasia felt a coldness like a fourth presence in the room. She looked at Narraway, but there was nothing in his face to suggest that he had felt it too or that he had heard their brief exchange. She accepted the wine, blood red in the lamplight, and drank to companionship in the journey, and wondered if each of them meant something different by the words. She had thought of the warmth, the love of discovery, friendship, however brief. Did the old man mean something more? She glanced at Narraway, but saw only interest in his face.</p><h2>Country Cooking of Italy hc</h2><p>Offers a look at the regional foods of Italy.

It could change your life and your love forever. <br>&nbsp;<br>If you are a woman in a relationship with a man who is struggling with sexual sin, this book can help you in ways you never imagined. You will be amazed that there are so many other women who share your experience. These women have been through that same dreadful period of sensing something in a relationship was not right, and at the same time being unable to identify exactly what was wrong or who was at fault. They have felt the same searing anger that arose when you realized you were being betrayed. They have experienced the same feelings of inadequacy and the false belief that, <i>If I had just been more of a woman, he would have remained faithful and pure. </i>They have been blamed for his problems and carried the weight of his shame.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you have been through what these women have been through, this book will help you see yourself, your circumstances, and your husband&#x2019;s problem in a different light.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Every Heart Restored </i>will guide you from dark despair to new hope, from resentful bitterness to emotional freedom, from protective detachment to the possibility of a deep connection with your husband. The transition and transformation won&#x2019;t be instant, nor will they be easy. Restoration is going to take some hard work on your part, at a time when you may feel you have worked hard enough and are ready to give up. But if you follow the path laid out here by Fred and Brenda Stoeker, your heart can be restored&#x2014;even if your husband is unwilling to make changes. You will be able to live in freedom even if he chooses to remain in bondage to sexual sin.<br>&nbsp;<br>Not every relationship can be salvaged, and perhaps restoration and freedom seem impossible to you now. But there is hope. God can use this book as a tool to restore your heart.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you have felt lost and confused through this journey with your husband and his battle with sexual sin, you are not alone. A friend of mine has an extremely bright little boy named Carter. At the age of four, he and his mother were in a discussion about why Jesus came to die on a cross for us. Carter, recalling Christ&#x2019;s last words, &#x201c;Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing&#x201d; (Luke 23:34), very confidently told his mom that Jesus died because, &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know what we are doing down here.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t think it has ever been said better. <i>We don&#x2019;t know what we are doing down here. </i>And when it comes to sex, that could not be more true.<br>&nbsp;<br>Part of the problem for men can be traced back to 1953 when Hugh Hefner began saturating the world with his philosophy, which was articulated in his <i>Playboy </i>magazine. Hefner talked about a new view of sex without any boundaries or shame attached. He told us men that if we used the pornography he wanted to sell to us, it would make us more sophisticated, more sexual, and much better lovers. Millions of men bought into that philosophy and made Heffner (and other pornographers like him) rich.<br>&nbsp;<br>The problem was that Hugh Hefner lied. Then later, with the establishment and accessibility of the Internet, we have seen the true result of pornography: It has not made men more sexually capable and competent; it has made them impotent. Pornography has objectified women and turned the hearts of men away from them. All over the world men have failed to perform sexually unless they are stimulated with pornography. And beautiful women have been destroyed when a man has to pull out a <i>Playboy </i>or turn on a video and look at it while he has sex with his wife.<br>&nbsp;<br>Not only has pornography caused men to be weak sexual partners, it has disconnected them from those they love. This disconnection is often the first step toward a painful divorce and the end of what God intended to be great. <i>We simply don&#x2019;t know what we are doing down here.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>But now, men are starting to wake up to the <i>Playboy</i>-porn lie and get their acts together, resulting in hope for marriage and hope for discouraged and persevering wives. There is a counter sexual revolution going on, and men are turning away from their sexual sins and back to their wives for all their sexual gratification. Men are aware that their decision to do so does not heal the hurt and resentments that have built up over the years. And that is where this book comes in.<br>&nbsp;<br>For some time now my team and I have been conducting seminars for men struggling with sexual integrity. (You can find out more about The Every Man&#x2019;s Battle Workshop at NewLife.com.) The results of those seminars have been amazing Lives have been changed, marriages saved, and hearts restored. Men from all walks of life&#x2014;pastors, truck drivers, entertainers, single fathers, old and young&#x2014;have straggled into the sessions, burdened with the guilt and shame of their past misdeeds. They have often come kicking and screaming, not wanting to be there, not wanting to pay for the workshop, and not wanting to change. But even though they have shown up under the worst of circumstances and the weakest of motivations, miraculously we have seen dramatic transformation, repentance, and healing.<br>&nbsp;<br>The last day of each workshop is filled with open confession and relentless tears as men turn from God-defying pasts to become God&#x2019;s men.<br>&nbsp;<br>As these transformed men have returned home to bruised women like you, we have realized the possibility of a relational disaster&#x2014;the reunion is usually fraught with difficulties even though he has obtained help for his wandering eyes and heart. He has returned intent on giving his wife full attention and wanting a deeper connection. He has now committed to receive all of his sexual gratification from her. But just when he is wanting her the most, his wife often is starting to resent him the most&#x2014;as the full reality of his problem becomes evident to her. He wants to confess past sins that are not quickly or easily forgiven. So at the height of her anger, he wants to be with her in a new way and experience intimacy that perhaps the couple has never known before. He wants her to trust him, while her stagnant<br>heart wonders if he can ever be trusted and if she can ever fully love him again. The aftermath of sexual sin is a tough place for both husband and wife.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is yet another element of despair for many women whose husbands have been involved in sexual sin. After reading <i>Every Man&#x2019;s Battle </i>or attending the workshop, his transformation begins and is often noticeable to others. People start to admire him for the changes he has made and the new way of living he has so bravely embraced. Ironically, the husband who betrayed his wife becomes a moral hero and is often sought out for counsel. For years she struggled, persevered, and served through his sin. But now, within weeks, all of that appears forgotten as he becomes the man of the hour. Her frustration with this new role can lead to her abandonment of the relationship at a time when it has the greatest opportunity to<br>thrive.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you have experienced any of these emotional and spiritual dilemmas, I know your pain is real and deep. Now here is a resource for you or any woman who has sacrificed for a man who has been sexually unfaithful. Whether it was Internet porn, compulsive masturbation, or an actual physical affair, this book will help you understand him. It will help you understand why he did what he did and show you that you were not responsible for it, even though he might have tried to convince you otherwise.<br>&nbsp;<br>In no way do you have ultimate responsibility for what he did to you and your marriage. But no one is perfect&#x2014;especially in difficult circumstances such as those you have been through. The tough reality is that you might have contributed to problems in your marriage (not caused them, but made some contribution to them). For numerous reasons, you might not have been available to him in the ways he thought you should be. You might have withheld sex from him altogether. While that did not help the situation, it did not force him to be unfaithful. That was his choice. Now, both of you have choices, and <i>Every Heart Restored </i>will help you make the best ones with the greatest likelihood for success.<br>&nbsp;<br>I close this foreword with the words of Jesus. In John 5 we find the story of Jesus at the pool of Bethesda with a man who had been seeking healing there for thirty-eight years. Jesus asked the man a simple question that all of us must answer as well: &#x201c;Do you want to get well?&#x201d; (verse 6). Healing is a choice, a choice we hope you make as you read this wonderful book.</p><h2>Tree House Book</h2><p>If you think tree houses are just for kids, you are wrong.

Mertz brings a novelist�s skills to this popular history of ancient Egypt, first published in 1990, so the prose is hardly academic. However, even though the material has been revised and updated, it still feels dated in both its content and its cloying, almost patronizing, style.

This is a shocking oversight of an award-winning poet, novelist, essayist, educator, and activist as well as friend and mentor to many prominent African American writers. <i>Song of My Life</i> reintroduces Margaret Walker to readers by telling her story, one that many can relate to as she overcame certain obstacles related to race, gender, and poverty.</p><p>Walker was born in 1915 in Birmingham, Alabama, to two parents who prized education above all else. Obtaining that education was not easy for either her parents or herself, but Walker went on to earn both her master's and doctorate. from the University of Iowa. Walker's journey to become a nationally known writer and educator is an incredible story of hard work and perseverance. Her years as a public figure connected her to Richard Wright, Langston Hughes, Alex Haley, and a host of other important literary and historical figures.</p><p>This biography opens with her family and those who inspired her--her parents, her grandmother, her most important teachers and mentors--all significant influences on her reading and writing life. Chapters trace her path over the course of the twentieth century as she travels to Chicago and becomes a member of the South Side Writers' Group with Richard Wright. Then she is accepted into the newly created Masters of Fine Arts Program at the University of Iowa. Back in the South, she pursued and achieved her dream of becoming a writer and college educator as well as wife and mother. Walker struggled to support herself, her sister, and later her husband and children, but she overcame financial hardships, prejudice, and gender bias and achieved great success. She penned the acclaimed novel <i>Jubilee </i>, received numerous lifetime achievement awards, and was a beloved faculty member for three decades at Jackson State University in Jackson, Mississippi.</p></p><p><p>The first biography of the much admired author of the novel <i>Jubilee</i> and the poem "For My People"</p>Carolyn J.

Nathaniel Fick&#x2019;s career begins with a hellish summer at Quantico, after his junior year at Dartmouth. He leads a platoon in Afghanistan just after 9/11 and advances to the pinnacle&#x2014;Recon&#x2014; two years later, on the eve of war with Iraq. His vast skill set puts him in front of the front lines, leading twenty-two Marines into the deadliest conflict since Vietnam. He vows to bring all his men home safely, and to do so he&#x2019;ll need more than his top-flight education. Fick unveils the process that makes Marine officers such legendary leaders and shares his hard-won insights into the differences between military ideals and military practice, which can mock those ideals.<br><br>In this deeply thoughtful account of what it&#x2019;s like to fight on today&#x2019;s front lines, Fick reveals the crushing pressure on young leaders in combat. Split-second decisions might have national consequences or horrible immediate repercussions, but hesitation isn&#x2019;t an option. One Bullet Away never shrinks from blunt truths, but ultimately it is an inspiring account of mastering the art of war.</p><p>After receiving a BA in classics from Dartmouth, Nathaniel Fick served as an infantry oficer and then as an elite Recon Marine. He saw action in Afghanistan and Iraq before leaving the Corps as a captain. He is now a Fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, D.C. He is the author of the New York Times bestseller ONE BULLET AWAY. Fick is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the International Institute of Strategic Studies, and serves as a Director of the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation and the Rockefeller Center for Public Policy at Dartmouth College. He holds a B.A. from Dartmouth, an MBA from the Harvard Business School, and an MPA in international security policy from Harvard&#39;s John F. Kennedy School of Government.1<br><br>Fifteen of us climbed aboard the ancient white school bus. Wire mesh covered its windows and four black words ran along its sides: UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS.<br> Dressed casually in shorts and sandals, we spread out and sat alone with our bags. Some sipped coffee from paper cups, and a few unfolded newspapers they had brought. I found a seat near the back as the bus started with a roar and a cloud of smoke blew through the open windows.<br> A second lieutenant, looking crisp in his gabardine and khaki uniform, sat in the front row. He had just graduated from Officer Candidates School, and would escort us on the hour&#x2019;s drive to the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia. Shortly after we pulled away from the recruiting office, he stood in the aisle and turned to face us. I expected a welcome, a joke, some commiseration.<br> Honor, courage, and commitment are the Marines&#x2019; core values,&#x201d; the lieutenant shouted over the engine.<br>He sounded scripted, but also sincere. If you can&#x2019;t be honest at OCS, how can the Corps trust you to lead men in combat?&#x201d; Combat. I glanced around the bus&#x2019;s gunmetal interior, surprised to see people reading or pretending to sleep. No one answered the lieutenant&#x2019;s question. He stood there in the aisle, glaring at us, and I sat up a little straighter. The lieutenant was my age, but he looked different. Shorter hair, of course, and broader shoulders. It was more than that. He had an edge, something in his jaw or his brow that made me self-conscious.<br> I turned toward the window to avoid his gaze. Families drove next to us, on their way to the lake or the beach. Kids wearing headphones gawked, surely wondering what losers were riding a school bus in the summertime. A girl in an open Jeep stood and started to raise her shirt before being pulled back down by a laughing friend. They waved and accelerated past. I thought of my friends, spending their summer vacations in New York and San Francisco, working in air-conditioned office towers and partying at night. Staring through the wire mesh at the bright day, I thought this must be what it&#x2019;s like on the ride to Sing Sing. I wondered why I was on that bus.<br><br>I went to Dartmouth intending to go to med school. Failing a chemistry class had inspired my love of history, and I ended up majoring in the classics. By the summer of 1998, my classmates were signing six-figure contracts as consultants and investment bankers. I didn&#x2019;t understand what we, at age twenty-two, could possibly be consulted about. Others headed off to law school or medical school for a few more years of reading instead of living. None of it appealed to me. I wanted to go on a great adventure, to prove myself, to serve my country. I wanted to do something so hard that no one could ever talk shit to me. In Athens or Sparta, my decision would have been easy. I felt as if I had been born too late. There was no longer a place in the world for a young man who wanted to wear armor and slay dragons.<br> Dartmouth encouraged deviation from the trampled path, but only to join organizations like the Peace Corps or Teach for America. I wanted something more transformative. Something that might kill me or leave me better, stronger, more capable. I wanted to be a warrior.<br> My family had only a short martial tradition. My maternal grandfather, like many in his generation, had served in World War II.<br>He was a Navy officer in the South Pacific, and his ship, the escort carrier Natoma Bay, fought at New Guinea, Leyte Gulf, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, often supporting Marine invasion forces ashore. At 0635 on June 7, 1945, so the family story went, only two months before the end of the war, a Japanese kamikaze crashed into the Natoma Bay&#x2019;s flight deck. The explosion tore a hole in the steel twelve feet wide and twenty feet long. Shrapnel peppered my grandfather&#x2019;s body. My mother remembers watching him pick pieces of metal from his skin twenty years later. He had some of that shrapnel melted into a lucky horseshoe, which was shown to me with great reverence when I was a child.<br> My father enlisted in the Army in 1968.<br>When most of his basic training class went to Vietnam, he received orders to the Army Security Agency. He spent a year in Bad Aibling, Germany, eavesdropping on Eastern bloc radio transmissions and waiting for the Soviets to roll through the Fulda Gap. He completed OCS just as President Richard Nixon began drawing down the military, and took advantage of an early out to go to law school. But my dad was proud to have been a soldier.<br> The Army sent me a leetter during my junior year at Dartmouth, promising to pay for graduate school.<br>The Navy and Air Force did the same, promising skills and special training.<br>The Marine Corps promised nothing. Whereas the other services listed their benefits, the Corps askeeeeed, Do you have what it takes?&#x201d; If I was going to serve in the military, I would be a Marine.<br> A few months before, I&#x2019;d seen a poster in the dining hall advertising a talk by Tom Ricks. Then the Wall Street Journal&#x2019;s Pentagon correspondent, Ricks had recently written a book about the Marines. I sat up most of one night reading it. I arrived early to get a good seat and listened as Ricks explained the Corps&#x2019;s culture and the state of civil-military relations in the United States. His review of the Marines, or at least my interpretation of it, was glowing. The Marine Corps was a last bastion of honor in society, a place where young Americans learned to work as a team, to trust one another and themselves, and to sacrifice for a principle. Hearing it from a recruiter, I would have been skeptical.<br>But here was a journalist, an impartial observer.<br> The crowd was the usual mix of students, faculty, and retired alumni. After the talk, a young professor stood. How can you support the presence of ROTC at a place like Dartmouth?&#x201d; she asked. It will militarize the campus and threaten our culture of tolerance.&#x201d; Wrong,&#x201d; replied Ricks. It will liberalize the military.&#x201d; He explained that in a democracy, the military should be representative of the people. It should reflect the best of American society, not stand apart from it. Ricks used words such as duty&#x201d; and honor&#x201d; without cynicism, something I&#x2019;d not often heard at Dartmouth.<br> His answer clinched my decision to apply for a slot at Marine OCS during the summer between my junior and senior years of college. I would have laughed at the idea of joining the Corps on a bet or because of a movie, but my own choice was almost equally capricious. Although I had reached the decision largely on my own, Tom Ricks, in an hour-long talk on a cold night at Dartmouth, finally convinced me to be a Marine.<br> But even joining the Marines didn&#x2019;t seem as crazy as it had to my parents&#x2019; generation. This was 1998, not 1968. The United States was cashing in its post cold war peace dividend. Scholars talked about the end of history,&#x201d; free markets spreading prosperity throughout the world, and the death of ideology. I would be joining a peacetime military. At least that&#x2019;s the rationale I used when I broke the news to my parents. They were surprised but supportive. The Marines,&#x201d; my dad said, will teach you everything I love you too much to teach you.&#x201d;<br><br>The Marine Corps base in Quantico straddles Interstate 95, sprawling across thousands of acres of pine forest and swamp thirty miles south of Washington. Our bus rumbled through the gate, and we drove past rows of peeling warehouses and brick buildings identified only by numbered signs. They looked like the remnants of some dead industry, like the boarded-up mills on the riverbanks of a New Hampshire town.<br> Christ, man, where&#x2019;re the ovens? This place looks like Dachau.&#x201d; Only a few forced laughs met this quip from someone near the back of the bus.<br> We drove farther and farther onto the base along the edge of a swamp, through miles of trees, far enough to feel as if they could kill us here and no one would ever know. That, of course, was the desired effect.<br> When the air brakes finally hissed and the door swung open, we sat in the middle of a blacktop parade deck the size of three football fields.<br> Austere brick barracks surrounded it. A sign at the blacktop&#x2019;s edge read UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS OFFICER CANDIDATES SCHOOL DUCTUS EXEMPLO. I recognized the motto from Latin class: Leadership by Example.&#x201d; I hoped a drill instructor in a Smokey Bear hat would storm onto the bus and order us off to stand on yellow footprints. Pop culture has immortalized the arrival of enlistedMarine recruits at Parris Island, South Carolina. But this was OCS, and the lack of theatrics disappointed me. A fresh-faced Marine with a clipboard took the roll by Social Security number and then handed a pencil to each of us, saying we had a lot of paperwork to fill out.<br> For two days, we shuffled from line to line for haircuts, gear issue, and a battery of physical tests.<br>Candidates who had returned after being dropped from previous OCS classes explained this routine: the schedule was designed to minimize the number of us who flunked out for high blood pressure. On day three, with physical evaluations completed, the hammer would fall.<br> We slept in squad bays with fifty bunks per room. There, on the evenings before OCS really started, I got my first lesson in esprit de corps. OCS is competitive. Since the peacetime Marine Corps needs a fixed number of officers, a certain number of candidates are earmarked to graduate while the rest are destined to fail. I thought this put us in competition with one another, but the candidates who had been dropped before, or who had served as enlisted Marines, shared their knowledge with the rest of us.<br> The Corps is a naval service, with nautical vocabulary. Doors are hatches, walls are bulkheads, and floors are decks. Signs at Quantico, miles from the sea, read WELCOME ABOARD. They also taught us the more arcane language of the Marines. Running shoes were called go-fasters. Our flashlights, worn on the hip at OCS, were moonbeams. When we looked confused, one of the prior-service Marines laughed. Just wait till you get to the Fleet, he told us. Three different pieces of equipment were known as a donkey dick&#x201d; a radio antenna, a brush for cleaning mortar tubes, and a funnel for fueling Humvees.<br> In the beginning, my strongest impression of Quantico, apart from its isolation, was its timelessness.<br>Looking around the squad bay, I could imagine Franklin Roosevelt in the White House. No plastic, no advertising, no bright colors. Just two-high metal racks, as our bunks were called, a green linoleum floor, brick walls, and bare bulbs overhead. The only decoration was a sign of two-foot-high letters stenciled along an entire wall: HONOR, COURAGE, COMMITMENT. I already had the feeling that the Marines were a world apart, that what we did at OCS would be separate from the rest of my life.<br> When another candidate dragged a wooden footlocker next to mine and sat down, I was glad of the company.<br> I&#x2019;m Dave Adams.&#x201d; He stuck out his hand.<br> Dave was a football player at William and Mary. His brother had gone to Dartmouth. His easy smile made me like him right away.<br> So what do you think?&#x201d; I tried to ask the question with less trepidation than I felt.<br> Dave smiled and said, I think we&#x2019;re in for a shitty summer. But I&#x2019;ve wanted to be a Marine since I was a kid. What&#x2019;s that saying? Pain is temporary. Pride is forever.&#x2019;&#x201d; I saw a bumper sticker in the parking lot that said Nobody ever drowned in sweat.&#x2019;&#x201d; I was nervous. Not scared or intimidated that would come later but apprehensive. The Marine transformation is one of American life&#x2019;s storied tests. I knew its reputation was earned.<br> We had the barest taste of it at the supply warehouse on the morning of the ominous third day. All the candidates lined up and moved from bin to bin, selecting green camouflage blouses and trousers, nylon belts with two olive-drab canteens attached, and odd items such as bug spray labeled Repellent, Arthropod.&#x201d; Two young Marines in the warehouse took advantage of the chance to hassle a group of future officers.<br> Get at parade rest!&#x201d; It was an alien command. I clasped my hands in front of me and tried to look respectful.<br> You gonna gaff us off? Get at the position of attention.&#x201d; The candidates around me stood a little straighter, with their hands at their sides. The two Marines told us there were only two ways to stand at OCS: parade rest feet shoulder-width apart, hands clasped in the small of the back, eyes straight ahead; and at attention heels together, back straight, hands at your sides with thumbs along the trouser seams.<br> Later, we assembled for lunch in a Word War II era Quonset hut. Baking in this sun-beaten aluminum oven, we munched processed meat sandwiches and apples a prepared lunch the Marines called a boxed nasty&#x201d; as the school&#x2019;s commanding officer (CO) outlined his expectations of us. The colonel&#x2019;s lantern jaw, craggy nose, and graying hair were straight from a recruiting commercial. He looked as if he could wrestle any of us to the floor, and authority ran deep in his voice.<br> We seek to identify in each candidate those qualities of intellect, human understanding, and moral character that enable a person to inspire and to control a group of people successfully: leaders,&#x201d; he said. A candidate&#x2019;s presence under pressure is a key indicator of leadership potential. In trying to identify Marine leaders who may someday face combat, we want to see who can think and function under stress. Stress at OCS is created in many ways, as you will see.&#x201d; When the colonel concluded, he called forward the school&#x2019;s staff, introducing each Marine. All had served as drill instructors. At OCS, though, they were called sergeant instructors,&#x201d; and we would address them by that title, their rank, and their name. The staff marched smartly down the aisle and stood at attention before us. Khaki uniforms with splashes of colored ribbons, eyes focused over our heads on the back wall of the room, no smiles. They were sergeants, staff sergeants, and gunnery sergeants, mostly men with ten to twenty years in the Corps. I saw scars and biceps and tattoos. With introductions complete, the colonel turned to the staff and uttered ten words that ended our civilian lives: Take charge and carry out the plan of the day.&#x201d; Tables turned over, chairs clattered to the floor, and I forgot all about the half-eaten apple in my hand.<br>The staff charged us. We ran out the back door of the Quonset hut. I wanted to keep running, to disappear into the woods, make my way out to the highway, and hitchhike home. But pride trumps most other impulses in young men, and I fell into a ragged formation with my new platoon-mates.<br> Stop eyeballing the freakin&#x2019; area, maggot.&#x201d; My eyes were locked to the front. I didn&#x2019;t think he was talking to me. Warm, wet breath on my cheeks. If not me, then someone right next to me.<br> Lock your body!&#x201d; Spittle across my eyes and lips. The Marine strutted up and down our crooked ranks. He spoke to the group, but in a way that made it personal for each of us.<br> If you so much as breathe, I&#x2019;ll hear it and rip your freakin&#x2019; windpipe out. Now grab your freakin&#x2019; trash and move with purpose. Pretend for me that you want to be here.&#x201d; We shouldered our bags. Candidates with foresight had brought hiking packs. They stood comfortably, looking ready to strike out down the Appalachian Trail. The truly lost labored with their leather brief bags and suitcases. I fell somewhere in between, striving mightily to be inconspicuous with an oversize duffel bag.<br> I snuck a look at the instructor&#x2019;s nametag. Olds. Three stripes on his shoulder. Sergeant Olds. He was yelling, veins popping, eyes bulging. His arms waved from broad shoulders that tapered to his waist with all the menacing grace of a wasp. I looked at S...</p><h2>The Kentucky Derby: How the Run for the Roses Became America&#39;s Premier Sporting Event</h2><p><p>Each year on the first Saturday in May, the world turns its attention to the twin spires of Churchill Downs for the high-stakes excitement of the "greatest two minutes in sports," the Kentucky Derby. No American sporting event can claim the history, tradition, or pageantry that the Kentucky Derby holds. For more than 130 years, spectators have been fascinated by the magnificent horses that run the Louisville track. Thoroughbreds such as Secretariat and Barbaro have earned instant international fame, along with jockeys such as Isaac Murphy, Ron Turcotte, and Calvin Borel. <i>The Kentucky Derby: How the Run for the Roses Became America's Premier Sporting Event</i> calls this great tradition to post and illuminates its history and culture.</p><p>Rising from its humble beginnings as an American variation of England's Epsom Derby, the Kentucky Derby became a centerpiece of American sports and the racing industry, confirming Kentucky's status as the Horse Capital of the World. James C. Nicholson argues that the Derby, at its essence, is a celebration of a place, existing as a connection between Kentucky's mythic past and modern society. The Derby is more than just a horse race -- it is an experience enhanced by familiar traditions, icons, and images that help Derby fans to understand Kentucky and define themselves as Americans. Today the Kentucky Derby continues to attract international attention from royalty, celebrities, racing fans, and those who simply enjoy an icy mint julep, a fabulous hat, and a wager on who will make it to the winner's circle.</p><p>Nicholson provides an intriguing and thorough history of the Kentucky Derby, examining the tradition, spectacle, culture, and evolution of the Kentucky Derby -- the brightest jewel of the Triple Crown.</p></p><p><p><b>James C. Nicholson</b> is the author of <i>Never Say Die: A Kentucky Colt, the Epsom Derby, and the Rise of the Modern Thoroughbred Industry</i>.</p><p>"Winner of the Kentucky Literary Award for Non-fiction</p><p>Winner of the the Kentucky History Award" -- </p><br><br><p>"Many books have been published about the Kentucky Derby that deal with elements of the race such as the horses, jockeys, owners, and trainers. This book is much more than that -- it places the Derby within the history of the Commonwealth and in the broader context of American culture." -- John Kleber, editor of <i>The Kentucky Encyclopedia</i></p><br><br><p>"Nicholson has done a masterful job of researching the historical events that made the Derby the enthralling and significant event it is... You may never get to experience the thrill of entering the winners' circle and smelling the wonderful aroma that emanates from the garland of roses that signifies the greatest achievement in the sport of Thoroughbred racing, but this wonderful book will take you on a journey that gets you as close as any piece of writing possibly could." -- Chris McCarron, two-time Kentucky Derby winner and Hall of Fame inductee, from the foreword</p><br><br><p>"I have witnessed every modern Derby beginning in 1964 and have been privileged to write about the Derby many times. Through all of that involvement, however, I could never say that I really had my arms around just how the race came to be so embedded into the American soul. Now, Nicholson has provided that insight. In his lively telling, he explains the many strands of what is not so much a picture as a tapestry. Moreover, he brings us up to date as to the Derby's ability to withstand the winds of social change wrought by warfare, racial relations, and, of late, the international aspects of the grand old race." -- Edward L. Bowen, author of nineteen books on Thoroughbred racing</p><br><br><p>"Nicholson's connections to the Thoroughbred industry all combine in this flowing, colorful but painstakingly-accurate history of the Kentucky Derby. His story is the design, the warp and weave of the fabric, and he knew where to source the embellishments which give this work its unique personality. Read this book and you will understand why, each year, this great nation holds its breath for two minutes late in the afternoon on the first Saturday in May." -- Terence Collier, Fasig-Tipton Company, Inc.</p><br><br><p>"Nicholson has done a great job putting together historical facts and telling just enough of a story to make his book very interesting. It is obvious that the influence of his family's history and experiences in racing have helped him achieve this goal." -- Richard Mandella, Hall of Fame trainer</p><br><br><p>"What is it about the Kentucky Derby that causes people who will not see another horse race all year to pay attention? The answer, James C. Nicholson explains, lies in the Derby's image being intertwined with that of Kentucky. The popular perception of the state as both genteel and untamed is played out in the event itself. In the early days of the Derby, an imagined link to the mythological Old South added to the appeal. Now, in the twenty-first century, the Derby has become an all-American sports experience. <i>The Kentucky Derby: How the Run for the Roses Became America's Premier Sporting Event</i> goes beyond the colorful history of the race and examines the reasons behind its popularity. It is not only an enjoyable read but also very enlightening." -- Tom Hammond, NBC Kentucky Derby Host</p><br><br><p>" <i>The Kentucky Derby: How the Run for the Roses Became America's Premier Sporting Event</i> is both informative and entertaining. Providing the reader with a unique insight into how the Kentucky Derby has evolved over the past 135 years, Nicholson illuminates the history of Kentucky's signature sporting event, highlighting the culture, history, and rich tradition surrounding it." -- Walt Robertson, Keeneland Vice President of Sales</p><br><br><p>"Keen observations... prove to be consistently powerful throughout the book, as the author touches on everything from the scandalous demise of celebrated black jockeys to the heavy influence of powerful Middle-Eastern sheiks." -- <i> <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></i></p><br><br><p>"Does an excellent job describing the aura that surrounds America's most popular thoroughbred race." -- <i> <i>Saratogan</i></i></p></p><h2>Panorama (Peter Owen World Series: Slovenia)</h2><p>In a manner reminiscent of W.G.

He left Russia in 1917 with his family, who settled in England and had George educated at Bedales and Brighton College.</p> <p>He made his British film debut in 1929, but it was in 1930&#x2019;s Hollywood that he honed his distinctive, charming-yet-dangerous screen persona &#x2013; the quintessential cad. Sanders co-starred in Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s <i>Rebecca</i> and <i>Foreign Correspondent</i> (both 1940), and went on to win an Academy Award for his signature role, that of Addison DeWitt in <i>All About Eve</i> (1950). He continued to work in films up until the year of his death in 1972.</p> <p>In the 1940&#x2019;s, Sanders&#x2019; film-star status was the impetus for his two crime novels, both featuring recognizably Sanders-esque heroes: <i>Crime on My Hands</i> (1944) and <i>Stranger at Home</i> (1946). In 1960 came a third book: his autobiography, fittingly titled <i>Memoirs of A Professional Cad</i> in which the line between fiction and fact is blurred even more convincingly &#x2013; and wittily &#x2013; than in the novels.

Corsi, Ph.D. meticulously details the psychological torment he was subjected to in what the media has simply called, &#x201c;The Mueller Investigation.&#x201d;<br> <br> In late 2018, in an FBI closed conference room with no windows, Dr. Corsi was confronted for hours upon hours at a time by detailed questioning about events that occurred in 2016. Dr. Corsi&#x2019;s inquisition was worthy of the Gestapo or KGB, designed to break even the most cooperating witness. Over a period of two months, three of Mueller&#x2019;s top prosecutors and an army of FBI agents&#x2014;up to nine government officials at a time&#x2014;questioned Dr. Corsi with his attorney, David Gray.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> Throughout this harrowing ordeal, Dr. Corsi handed over his personal computers, his cell phone, all of his email accounts, his Twitter account, and his Google account. Finding no &#x201c;smoking gun,&#x201d; Mueller&#x2019;s prosecutors blew up the meetings. Dr. Corsi refused to lie to the prosecutors to give them the ammunition they needed to prosecute Roger Stone, and as a result he was told he would be charged with a criminal offense for lying to the FBI and the Special Prosecutor.<br> <br> At seventy-two years of age, Dr. Corsi was subjected to extreme mental anguish, imagining that he may never see his family again as a free man.<br> <br> Rather than conducting an honest investigation, Mueller&#x2019;s Special Prosecutors reinforced a prefabricated narrative aiming to charge President Trump with Treason.&nbsp;<i>Silent No More: How I Became a Political Prisoner of Mueller&#x2019;s "Witch Hunt"</i>&nbsp;exposes the inner workings of this governmental escapade, and clearly states why Mueller has no case against the President.&nbsp;<br> <br> Dr. Corsi creates a compelling case indicating that the entire matter is an investigation in search of a crime&#x2014;to force lying testimony from witnesses if that&#x2019;s what it takes to achieve Deep State political objectives.</p><p>Jerome R.

Following the abolition of capital punishment in 1965 the secrets of the execution chamber were consigned to history, but due to changes in the secrecy laws a hangman is now able to tell the story of the work of public executioners and of the last moments of those who dropped to their deaths on the gallows. Syd Dernley&#39;s &#34;hidden life&#34; began on 29th March 1949, when he watched James Farrell hang at Birmingham&#39;s Winson Green Prison, and during the next four years he assisted in over 20 hangings. He was present at the execution of Timothy John Evans, the only man ever granted a posthumous free pardon. He recalls the differing behaviour of the condemned men - the frightened and the brave, and he reveals the nightmare that haunts every executioner - the hanging where things went wrong.</p><p></p><h2>Wonders of the Sea: Color Your Way to Calm</h2><p><b>A coloring book that will relax and inspire, all the while transporting you to the vibrant world that exists under the sea.<br><br></b>Travel underwater and let your imagination dive into the fabulous depths of the aquatic world.

A "water footprint" is the amount of fresh water used to produce the goods and services we consume, including growing, harvesting, packaging, and shipping. From the foods we eat to the clothes we wear to the books we read and the music we listen to, all of it costs more than what we pay at the check-out. The 125 footprint facts in this book show the true cost of our lifestyle and what it is doing to Earth, including draining it dry. </p><p> The "Virtual Water Concept" shows the amount of water used in human activities. Presented in clever, understandable graphics, <i>Your Water Footprint</i> raises readers' awareness of how much water is used to make the things we use, consume and grow. </p><p> What we put on our dinner table has a very high cost. Nearly 95 percent of our water footprint is hidden in the food we eat: </p><ul> <li> One pound of lettuce costs 15 gallons of freshwater; mango 190 gallons; avocado 220 gallons; tofu 244 gallons; rice 403 gallons; olives 522 gallons; pork 1,630 gallons; butter 2,044 gallons; chocolate 2,847 gallons; and beef 2,500 to 5,000 gallons. </li> <li> A slice of bread costs 10 gallons but if you eat it with a slice of cheese, it takes another 13 gallons. </li> <li> One glass of beer takes 20 gallons of water, and just one standard cup of tea costs 120 same-sized cups of water. </li> </ul><p></p><p> A cotton t-shirt takes almost as much water as beef, a pair of jeans even more. In fact, all aspects of our daily lives require water in some way, shape or form. The saying that "nothing is free" applies more to water than anything else we consume, considering just three percent of the world's water is drinkable and that we are using more of it than ever before. Factor in climate change, population growth and pollution and we have an unsustainable situation. Many experts predict dire water shortages if we continue on our current path. </p><p> <i>Your Water Footprint</i> is riveting. Consumers of all ages will be stunned by what it reveals. It is an excellent reference and an exciting way to introduce the resource-consumption equation to students. </p></p><p><p> Stephen Leahy is an environmental journalist based in Ontario, Canada.

He won the 2012 Prince Albert/United Nations Global Prize for Climate Change. </p><p>Excerpt from the Introduction </p><p> Do you know you're wearing water? It takes more than 7,600 liters (2,000 gallons) of water to make a single pair of jeans and another 2,460 liters (650 gallons) to make a T-shirt. And you're eating water too. That morning cup of coffee required 140 liters (37 gallons) of water before it found its way to your table--water that was used to grow, process and ship the coffee beans. If you include toast, two eggs and some milk in your coffee, the water footprint of your breakfast totals about 700 liters (185 gallons). </p><p> Furniture, houses, cars, roads, buildings--practically everything we make uses water in the manufacturing process. When we spend money on food, clothes, cellphones or even electricity, we are buying water. A lot of water. Generating electricity from coal, oil, gas, and nuclear or hydro power involves the world's second biggest use of water after food production. Making paper is another very water-intensive process. This book required about 980 liters (260 gallons) of water to produce, or more than your morning breakfast. </p><p> We are surrounded by a hidden world of water. This unseen water is called "virtual" or "embodied" water. Even though we don't see the water it took to make a T-shirt, couch or TV, that water is just as real as the water we drink or shower with. Each of us uses far more virtual water than the "regular" water we can see, feel and taste. </p><p> According to government statistics, the average American's direct water use (the "regular" water) is around 378 liters (100 gallons) every day for showers, toilet use, washing, cooking and drinking. The virtual water in the things we eat, wear and use during a day averages 7,500 liters (1,980 gallons). That means the average American's "water footprint"--the total amount of direct plus virtual freshwater use--is about 8,000 liters (2,115 gallons) per day. Since 1 liter weighs 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds), that's the weight of four cars you have to haul if you get all that water from a well. </p><p> Due to our excessive consumption habits, a North American's daily water footprint (direct plus virtual water) is more than twice the size of the global average. Think of it as running shoes placed side by side: the global shoe is a size 8, while the North American's is a size 18. By contrast, the Chinese or Indian water footprint is a tiny size 6. </p><p> </p><ul>The Water Footprint of a Bottle of Cola</ul> <p></p><p> To get a better understanding of virtual water and the water footprint concept, let's take a look at one popular product: a bottle of cola. Cola is almost entirely water, so a half-liter (17-ounce) bottle effectively contains 500 milliliters of water. That's the direct water input. But cola is not just water in a bottle. It contains sugar, carbon dioxide and syrup for flavoring. Sugar can be made from sugar beets, sugar cane or corn. All those crops need a lot of water to grow and to process into sugar, and the amount of water they need varies depending on where they are grown. If the sugar is made from corn grown in the United States, about 30 liters (7.9 gallons) of water was needed to grow and process the corn to make the sugar for our bottle of cola. The syrup flavoring contains small amounts of vanilla extract and caffeine from coffee beans. Vanilla and coffee require shockingly large amounts of water to grow and process. It takes about 80 liters (21 gallons) to grow and process the vanilla and 53 liters (14 gallons) to grow and process the coffee required to make just one bottle of cola. </p><p> The plastic cola bottle is made from oil. Water is crucial for the process of getting oil out of the ground and turning it into chemicals and plastics. Roughly 5 liters (1.3 gallons) of water is needed to make one half-liter (17-ounce) bottle. Then additional water is needed for packaging, shipping and so on, although these amounts are relatively small. Add all this together and the total water footprint of a bottle of cola is 175 liters (46 gallons). In other words, drinking a bottle of cola is like consuming 350 bottles of water. Stack them one on top of the other and they'd create a skinny water tower as tall as a 25-story building. </p><p> The word <i>consume</i> is used because the water footprints in this book represent amounts of water used that are not returned to an accessible location for reuse. Often water can be reused or cleaned, but the water footprint numbers here represent the net amount consumed. In other words, a water footprint is the total amount of water used, minus the clean water returned to a suitable source. </p><p> There are different ways to calculate a water footprint, so there may be differences in the numbers of liters consumed for various things. What's important is knowing that we depend on surprisingly large amounts of water in all facets of our daily lives. </p><p> Hardly anyone, including the business community and governments, is truly aware of how much water is needed to grow our food or manufacture consumer products. Yet water scarcity is already a reality in much of the world. About 1.2 billion people live in areas with chronic water scarcity, while another 2 billion are affected by shortages every year. And water scarcity is increasingly affecting people in the United States and Canada. By 2025, three in five people may be living with water shortages. </p><p> Planet Earth should really be known as Planet Water, since 70 percent of its surface is covered by water. About 97 percent of this is saltwater in the world's oceans. Of the 3 percent that is the planet's freshwater, 68.7 percent is encased in pack ice and glaciers, particularly in Antarctica and Greenland. Another 30 percent of our freshwater is in groundwater, and almost 1 percent in high-latitude permafrost. </p><p> Available freshwater is spread very unevenly across the planet. Canada has 9 percent of the world's freshwater, but most of that flows into the Arctic Ocean. Even with this abundance of water, 25 percent of Canadian municipalities have experienced water shortages. Many countries, including those in the Middle East, northern Africa, southern Europe and large parts of Asia, have relatively little water. </p><p> Lakes account for just 0.26 percent of global freshwater, while all Earth's mighty rivers amount to only a tiny 0.006 percent. Together rivers and lakes represent only 1/375th of all the freshwater on the planet. That's like a parking lot with 374 red cars and a single, lonely blue one representing all the world's rivers and lakes. </p><p> A water molecule--H2O--is made up of three atoms: two hydrogen and one oxygen. That simple configuration has near magical properties. You can freeze it, melt it, heat it and evaporate it. Almost anything can be dissolved in water. We often forget that Earth is literally a closed system, like a vessel in outer space. The total amount of water we have now is the same as it was a billion years ago. Water cannot be manufactured; it can only be moved around. We're very good at moving water around by using pipelines and canals. We're not so good at acknowledging that moving water around always means that some other place will then have less water. </p><p> Water is in constant motion. It evaporates from seas and continents, rains down from the clouds and flows from land to ocean through runoff. This is called the hydrological or water cycle. When rain falls, some of it evaporates and returns to the atmosphere; some is absorbed by soil and then taken up by plants. With enough rain, water runs off into a stream or river. Eventually all river water ends up in the world's oceans. </p><p> For a river basin or watershed to be sustainable, the amount of water we use should be no more than 20 percent of the precipitation that falls within it. Why not more? First, some of it evaporates. The warmer the temperatures and the drier the air, the more water evaporates. The mighty Great Lakes, containing about 20 percent of the world's surface freshwater, have experienced falling water levels in the past decade, mostly because of increased evaporation caused by warmer winter temperatures and</p></p><h2>Cats (Pocket Guides)</h2><p>Describes the characteristics and behavior of cats, shows a variety of both domestic and wild breeds, and includes information on caring for a cat as a pet</p><p></p><h2>A Wild Sheep Chase</h2><p>A mission to find a sheep with a star on its back; not a lost sheep but a sheep with a will of its own. His life was like his recurring nightmare: a train to nowhere. But an ordinary life has a way of taking an extraordinary turn. Add a girl whose ears are so exquisite that, when uncovered, they improve sex a thousand-fold, a runaway friend, a right-wing politico, an ovine-obsessed professor, and a manic-depressive in a sheep outfit, implicate them in a hunt for a sheep, that may or may not be running the world, and the upshot is another singular masterpiece from Japan&#39;s finest novelist.</p><p>A marvelous hybrid of mythology and mystery, A Wild Sheep Chase" is the extraordinary literary thriller that launched Haruki Murakami's international reputation. <br>It begins simply enough: A twenty-something advertising executive receives a postcard from a friend, and casually appropriates the image for an insurance company's advertisement. What he doesn't realize is that included in the pastoral scene is a mutant sheep with a star on its back, and in using this photo he has unwittingly captured the attention of a man in black who offers a menacing ultimatum: find the sheep or face dire consequences. Thus begins a surreal and elaborate quest that takes our hero from the urban haunts of Tokyo to the remote and snowy mountains of northern Japan, where he confronts not only the mythological sheep, but the confines of tradition and the demons deep within himself. Quirky and utterly captivating, A Wild Sheep Chase is Murakami at his astounding best.&#x201c;Murakami is a mythmaker for the millennium, a wiseacre wiseman.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>New York Times Book Review <br><br></i>"A delight . . . equal parts screwball comedy, detective story, and heroic quest." &#x2013;<i>USA Today</i><br>&#x201c;A witty adventure . . . a piece of verbal anarchy . . . a labyrinthine mystery from start to finish.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>San Francisco Chronicle<br></i><br>"Marvelously engaging, at turns witty, dry, wicked, even loopy.

Mills, clearly, has much to say on cult mentality and the confines of conformity." - <i>Washington Post</i></p><p>"Mills uses his blokes in the back of a pub to tell a massively ambitious story . . . A story that could be read as a disguised retelling of the Russian revolution, or the Reformation, or the Sunni-Shia schism, or any great human falling out. As soon as you form any kind of 'us,' Mills suggests, a 'them' will form in response. In this,<i> The Forensic Records Society</i> is like Animal Farm but with blokes for pigs, and much better songs." - <i>The Guardian</i></p><p>"A delightful absurdity, a surreal novel spinning at 45 RPM . . . a lovely commentary on politics and social interactions . . . beautifully written." <i>- San Francisco Book Review</i></p><p>"A gem of a novel about obsessive record collectors . . . hilarious."<i> - Dayton Daily News</i></p><p>"Mills [is] an earnestly whimsical and quietly subversive British writer . . . What Mills targets is the thirst for hierarchy, rules and regulations, schisms, spies in each society . . . The novel's light and clever with its male characters' passion for order and conspiratorial aspirations. And these can be applied to all human organizations, as Mills applies his scalpel to such ingrained compulsions."<i> - Providence Journal</i></p><p>"An allegory about power, ambition and primal struggles for supremacy. It works wonderfully well because it is so distilled and so funny . . . A novel that feels like an off-kilter Nick Hornby starts to be imbued with the spirit of Harold Pinter. It is quite remarkable how, on such a tiny canvas, Mills can achieve such stunning effects . . . A discomforting read as well as a hugely enjoyable one." - <i>The Independent</i></p><p>"Tremendously funny. Mills is one of Britain's best comic writers, and this is an excellent introduction to his scrupulously amusing world." - <i>The Spectator</i></p><p>"A pithy allegorical critique of how wider contemporary society works . . . Understated, precise, observational prose . . . A brisk and entertaining read. Bloomsbury have pushed the boat out with the packaging, which is a wonderful pastiche of the sort of vintage 1960s 7-inch single sleeve collectors covet at record fairs, and will really make you think there must be three minutes of music as well as 180 pages of prose to discover inside." - <i>The Herald Scotland</i></p><p>"Funny . . . a unique achievement . . . It's as if Don DeLillo had gone for a pint in an old English pub." - <i>Irish Times</i></p><p>"<i>The Forensic Record Society </i>feels fresh for tackling the issue of societal disintegration with a revamped style . . .

Bidart, a poet who makes a large arc between the universal and the idiosyncratic, has learned that the transformations themselves, rendered without comment, have the capacity to chill your blood. <p> The source for "The Second Hour of the Night" is Ovid's story of Myrrha and her father Cinyras, one of the least-known but most suggestive tales--a reversal of the Oedipus myth. Bidart's tormented dramatization of Ovid's version reads like an investigation into the deepest layers of the story. While both poets turn the doomed heroine into a plant, Bidart looks into causes and motivation in a way that Ovid does not. </p><p> The short poems in the first section of <i>Desire</i> are also very strong.

In this wide-ranging and philosophical memoir, author Paul Lee recounts his first serendipitous meeting with Chadwick in Santa Cruz, California, in 1967, and their subsequent founding of the Chadwick Garden at UC Santa Cruz, the first organic and biointensive garden at a U.S. university. <br><br>Today, there are few who would dispute the ecological and health benefits of organically produced food, and the student garden project founded by Chadwick and Lee has evolved into a world-renowned research center that helps third-world farmers obtain high yields using organic gardening. But when Chadwick and Lee first broke ground in the 1960s, the term "organic" belonged to the university's chemists, and the Chadwick Garden spurred a heated battle against the whole system of industrial existence. Lee's memoir contextualizes this struggle by examining the centuries-old history of the conflict between industrial science and organic nature, the roots of the modern environmental movement and the slow food movement, and the origin of the term "organic." His account of Chadwick's work fills in a gap in the history of the sustainable agriculture movement and proposes that Chadwick's groundwork continues to bear fruit in today's burgeoning urban garden, locavore, and self-sufficiency movements.<br><br>Table of contents:<br>Chapter one The English Gardener Arrives<br>Chapter two The English Gardener Goes to Work<br>Chapter three The Garden Plot<br>Chapter four Goethe the Vitalist contra Newton the Physicalist<br>Chapter five Urea!

Lee</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b>An excerpt from the book <i>There Is a Garden in the Mind: A Memoir of Alan Chadwick and the Organic Movement in California</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>Alan Chadwick arrived one day in 1967, some weeks after I had organized a walk with the chancellor and a group of interested people to look for a possible site for a garden project. It was an irresistible impulse, the source of which I did not know. I thought a garden on the campus would be a good idea, but I wasn&#x2019;t clear about what prompted me to think so, or what I was supposed to do about it. Chadwick was coming, and I must have sensed it. I like thinking that now. It is one of the few experiences in my life in which, in retrospect, I have the feeling that I was guided.<br>&nbsp;<br>I wasn&#x2019;t interested in gardening; as a typical academic, I was interested in the idea of gardening. I thought it would be a good project for the students on the campus of a university that had been a great ranch landscape&#x2014;the Cowell Ranch&#x2014;with vistas looking out from redwood groves to Monterey Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The students could do the work. I would watch and oversee and enjoy the asters and the poppies when they bloomed. And, of course, in the mid-1960s, &#x201c;flower power&#x201d; was in the air, wafting down from the Haight-Ashbury on a cloud of smoke. We all got a whiff of that. I wanted to put flower power into practice.<br>&nbsp;<br>George Hunston Williams had been my church history professor at Harvard, and I had helped him with a book he wrote, <i>Wilderness and Paradise</i>, describing the history of these motifs in the Bible and throughout Western culture, transposed by analogy as desert and garden. The second half of his book is about the rise of higher education in America. Inspired by desert/wilderness and garden/paradise themes, pioneers from the east headed west to plant gardens in the wilderness, to start schools in accordance with the biblical directives, also reminiscent of the schools of Plato and Aristotle, which included gardens. It was the first time my name appeared in a book, in his list of acknowledgments. I like to think it was a sign of things to come, when I lived out those very motifs after relocating to Santa Cruz.<br>&nbsp;<br>Before I assumed my Santa Cruz teaching duties at Crown College, I taught for a year at Cowell College, where Page Smith was the provost. My colleague and office partner, Donald Nicholl, a visiting professor of history, had given a speech that affected me deeply, &#x201c;A Sense of Place,&#x201d; referring to his British friend David Jones, the artist and poet, whose sense of place was acutely attuned to Wales. Donald bemoaned the difficulty of achieving such a sense at a state university, where students were mostly subjected to bureaucratic processing: a secular desert where the spirit was at stake. On one of his last days before returning to England, we had a long talk about his impressions, and he spoke about the &#x201c;spiritual laceration&#x201d; he had suffered as a result of his visit, a phrase he borrowed from Dostoyevsky. He also had in mind something like the need for roots at an institution where the life of the spirit and spiritual roots were the last things on anyone&#x2019;s mind.<br>&nbsp;<br>I had seen a plan for the campus that called for a projected fixed population figure of 27,500, somehow arrived at as the target for each of the campus sites in the system. This meant something like 15,000 parking lots, which conjured up a lot of asphalt. I groaned under this institutional imposition on a great ranch landscape and could hear the redwoods groaning with me.<br>&nbsp;<br>I thought a student garden would help offset this institutional imposition.<br>&nbsp;<br>Santa Cruz was supposed to be the new beacon of hope for higher education, a major departure from the established campuses of the University of California, but for the fixed figure of the eventual population. Following the model of British universities, Santa Cruz would be comprised of smaller colleges, each of which would have a theme, a representative faculty, a library, dormitories, all under the aegis of the university, but autonomous units unto themselves. Cowell College, the first to open, in 1965, was devoted to the humanities. Teaching would be honored over publishing, so the promotional propaganda read, a promise that was not kept under the pressure of &#x201c;publish or perish,&#x201d; the bugbear of academic advancement.<br>&nbsp;<br>Some of us had the suspicion that the ulterior motive for a network of independent colleges was to disperse the students so they could not easily organize. Santa Cruz was a reaction to Berkeley and the mega-university of industrial technocracy, provocative of student unrest, which eventually erupted nationally in response to the Vietnam War. And erupt it did at Santa Cruz as well. Geographic distance between the colleges deterred no one in acting out their anguish over the war. <br>&nbsp;<br>A British flavor was injected into the culture of the university by using British academic terminology: <i>common rooms</i>, not <i>lounges</i>; <i>provosts</i>, not <i>deans</i>; <i>boards of study</i>, not <i>departments</i>; and a number of British professors were hired to carry through the influence, notable among them Jasper Rose, professor of art history, and Glenn Wilson in political science. <br>&nbsp;<br>I didn&#x2019;t have an English gardener in mind to further the theme, but I should have.<br>&nbsp;<br>A few weeks after the walk with the chancellor, the English gardener arrived, as though on schedule. He was told about my interest in a garden project by his friend Freya von Moltke, who was visiting the campus for a quarter. He had stopped off to visit her, returning from a trip to New Zealand, where he had thought of resettling. She had told him he wouldn&#x2019;t like it, and she was right. It was as though he wanted her to tell him what to do next. A week or two before, Freya and her companion, Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, a visiting professor at Cowell College, had come to our home for lunch, and she told me she had heard about my walk with the chancellor and that I wanted to start a garden. She had a friend coming who would do the garden for me. I said, &#x201c;Okay, Countess.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Freya was the widow of Count Helmuth von Moltke, one of the great figures in the resistance against Hitler. He was the leader of the Kreisau Circle, named after the estate he inherited as the grandnephew of the famous German General von Moltke, the founder of the modern German army under Bismarck, who was buried at Kreisau, making it a national shrine. For thinking about the future of Germany after Hitler, and holding secret planning sessions at Kreisau, Helmuth was accused of treason and was hanged from a meat hook with piano wire. There is a national memorial devoted to him and others at Pl�tzensee Prison in Berlin. He was caught up in the net of the Officers&#x2019; Bomb Plot, an unsuccessful attempt on Hitler&#x2019;s life, and even though he had been against assassination, he was executed for his ideas about the future of Germany. <br>&nbsp;<br>A woman of luminous beauty, with a voice to match, Freya had become the companion of Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, the great polymath, who fled Germany when Hitler came to power and who had worked with von Moltke in youth work service camps until Hitler nationalized them. Eugen had been Page Smith&#x2019;s professor at Dartmouth, where, in 1940, they had started Camp William James, a leadership training camp for the Civilian Conservation Corps. They wanted to bring the spirit of William James and the vision of his famous talk at Stanford in 1906, &#x201c;A Moral Equivalent of War,&#x201d; into what had become a kind of holding tank for welfare youth, due to the so-called means test one had to sign, indicating poverty, in order to be eligible for the corps. They had the blessing of Mrs. Roosevelt and Dorothy Thompson, the famous journalist, to open up the corps to the middle class, and so they started a camp for that purpose at Tunbridge, Vermont. It was short lived, and within months the adventure was over. The war had begun.<br>&nbsp;<br>Page had invited Rosenstock-Huessy to Santa Cruz to teach at Cowell College as a visiting professor after his retirement, and Freya accompanied him. <br>&nbsp;<br>I later came to realize that the short-lived effort on a farm in Vermont&#x2014;Camp William James&#x2014;was to be reborn in our Chadwick Garden in California, once the confluence of historical forces unfolded. It became clear to me only years later, after Page Smith and I teamed up to start the William James Association, in 1972, and later helped Jerry Brown, when governor of California, inaugurate the California Conservation Corps, with the hope of carrying through the Chadwick legacy. <br>&nbsp;<br>Freya was Chadwick&#x2019;s muse&#x2014;everyone could see why&#x2014;and the love of his life. They met and became friends in South Africa, where Chadwick had gone to act in a traveling theater company and eventually shifted to gardening at the Admiralty Gardens in Capetown.<br>&nbsp;<br>After the defeat of Germany and the loss of her estate&#x2014;Kreisau&#x2014;to the Russians, Freya had fled to Capetown with her sons to join family who had settled there. She met Alan in Capetown. After becoming friends, she told me how Alan had come to see her in her cottage. They had an argument, and Alan had displayed his famous temper and rode off on his bike, and as she was about to jump on her bike and chase after him, she knew that that would be it. It would be construed as a declaration of love with the implication of a possible marriage. Either/or. She stayed home.<br>&nbsp;<br>I remember Alan talking about the wildlife of Africa and his joy romping with the lions and tigers and the gazelles and whatnot as if he were one of them in his element. Freya&#x2019;s sons have fond memories of Alan and their friendship with Alan, acting as a substitute father and introducing them to nature&#x2019;s mysteries as only he could do.<br>&nbsp;<br>Who was Alan Chadwick? What were his roots? What was his background? Born on July 27, 1909, he was from landed gentry of considerable means and a family history of distinction going back generations. He often referred to Pudleston Court, the family estate after Swinton Hall, as if he had been brought up there in the lap of luxury, but Pudleston was sold about thirty years before Alan was born, although his grandfather retained the farms for the rental income. These lands could have been Alan&#x2019;s reference. He had china and silverware with the Chadwick crest, which I was led to believe were artifacts from Pudleston. He and his brother, Seddon, were brought up at &#x201c;Long Coppice,&#x201d; Bournemouth, where there is a stained-glass window bearing the Chadwick arms, so we are clear about his actual home and its location, not to be confused with one of the ancestral homes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Alan&#x2019;s father, Harry Chadwick, born in 1849, was a graduate of Oxford and a lawyer by profession. He met his second wife, Elizabeth Rarp, Alan&#x2019;s mother, at a hotel near Henley, where he attended the famous rowing races. His first wife, Jane Lane Boxall, was from famous stock; an ancestor, Jane Lane, saved the life of the king of England&#x2014;Charles II&#x2014;in an episode that was considered one of the great events of English history. It is one of eight historic incidents commemorated by eight-by-ten-foot frescoes in the Houses of Parliament. The king decreed that the first-born female in the line from then on should bear the name &#x201c;Jane Lane.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>[...]</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b>From <i>There Is a Garden in the Mind: A Memoir of Alan Chadwick and the Organic Movement in California </i>by Paul A.

How difficult is it to keep a series like this fresh, both for readers and for yourself?</p> <p><strong>John: </strong>Well, I still enjoy writing the Parker books, which helps a lot! I suppose that I made a few decisions early on which have stood me in good stead. One of those was to let Parker age gradually, so that the nature of the books would change as he changed. I always think of Robert B. Parker's Spenser series: I liked those books a lot, and they were always entertaining at the very least, but Spenser is vaguely ageless, and so the books remain kind of static. By contrast, James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux is now a man in his sixties, and his capacities&#x2014;and his fears&#x2014;are not the same as they were in his youth, which gives both a potency and a sadness to the books. </p> <p>A second decision I made was to have a larger narrative slowly being constructed over the course of the novels. While a reader can start anywhere in the series, by reading in sequence it becomes clear that there is a connecting thread running through them. I suppose it's a little like the difference between the TV crime series of the seventies&#x2014;<i>Columbo</i>, <i>The Rockford Files</i> and their ilk&#x2014;where each episode was entirely self-contained, and modern series like <i>The Wire</i> or <i>The Sopranos</i>, where part of the pleasure lies in watching the story unfold piece by piece. </p> <p>And finally, I take detours to do other books, like <i>The Book of Lost Things</i>, or the <i>Chronicles of the Invaders</i>, or the Samuel Johnson novels, which allows me to exercise some different muscles, and come back to Parker refreshed and maybe with one or two new skills under my belt.</p> <p><strong>Karin: </strong>Like most of the other novels in the series, The Wolf in Winter touches upon the supernatural. There is more of this blurring of the distinctions between genres now than in the past, but is there still an element of resistance to it among more traditional readers and critics?</p> <p><strong>John: </strong> I think a generation of mystery writers has emerged that is perhaps a little more experimental, and more willing to explore the areas of crossover between genres. I love the traditional mystery novel, whether hard-boiled or less explicit, but this doesn't mean that I consider the traditional form as the only way to write mysteries. I've always been curious to explore ideas of justice, compassion and redemption in my books. Because I was raised a Catholic, that word "redemption" comes freighted with a certain amount of spiritual baggage for me. I think it's interesting that the writers I admire a lot&#x2014;James Lee Burke, Michael Connelly, Dennis Lehane&#x2014;are also exploring that notion of redemption through their central characters, and all come from an Irish Catholic background. </p> <p>In the end, though, there remains a pretty conservative rump in mystery fiction which doesn't care much for the mixing of genres, and has a particular loathing for any hint of the supernatural. That harks back to the rationalist roots of the mystery novel, but I've always believed that life, and people, are much odder than an entirely rationalist viewpoint can encompass.</p> <p><strong>Karin: </strong> The novel seems fascinated by the Green Man mythos, which might not be familiar to readers from outside Europe. Where did that come from? </p> <p><strong>John: </strong> A lot of older churches throughout Europe often feature pagan symbolism, particularly faces that appear to be constructed from wood and ivy, and the name given to such depictions in England is "Green Man." I think it was a way for the early Christian Church to acknowledge certain beliefs that were, if not quite pagan, then very much manifestations of the people's connection to the land. Some of them are benevolent, but some of them are quite horrifying.

It was easier to write than the first one, I think. Collaboration is difficult for many writers, mainly because writing is, by its nature, quite a solitary profession. I struggled a bit with it for the first novel in the series, <i>Conquest</i>, because I'd become so used to working alone over the course of twenty books. But Jennie's input has made those books better.</p> <p>I'm also pretty close to finishing another Nocturnes collection of short stories and novellas and, as I write this, I'm working on the draft of the next Parker book. I'm going through a phase of being pretty prolific, and I'm making the most of it while I can. After all, who knows how long it will last?</p>John Connolly is author of the Charlie Parker mysteries, The Book of Lost Things, the Samuel Johnson novels for young adults and, with his partner, Jennifer Ridyard, co-author of the Chronicles of the Invaders. John Connolly&#39;s debut - EVERY DEAD THING - introduced the character of Private Investigator Charlie Parker, and swiftly launched him right into the front rank of thriller writers. All his subsequent novels have been Sunday Times bestsellers. He was the winner of the 2016 CWA Short Story Dagger for On the Anatomization of an Unknown Man (1637) by Frans Mier from NIGHT MUSIC: Nocturnes Vol 2. In 2007 he was awarded the Irish Post Award for Literature. He was the first non-American writer to win the US Shamus award and the first Irish writer to win an Edgar award. BOOKS TO DIE FOR, which he edited with Declan Burke, was the winner of the 2013 Anthony, Agatha and Macavity awards for Best Non-Fiction work.</p><h2>SPEAKING IN TONGUES</h2><p>Speaking in Tongues</p><p>ELLA FRANCES SANDERS&nbsp;is a writer out of necessity and an illustrator by accident.

I say &#x201c;introduction&#x201d; because this book would need to be thousands upon thousands of pages long (and several volumes after that) to include all the curious, magical, and transcendent sayings we use to express ourselves. It is a beginning; for you and for me.&nbsp;<br><br>The fifty-two proverbs, expressions, and idioms in these pages will perhaps give you new ways of thinking about the world around you; hopefully, they will breathe some magnificent life into the everyday&#x2014;color the view slightly differently so that you might be able to see the previously unseen. Most of these sayings reference the natural world in some way&#x2014;the landscapes and creatures and vegetables alongside which we have evolved&#x2014;and this says an awful lot about how we have made sense of things in the past, and how we make sense of things now&#x2014;whether the saying is from a Scandinavian language or an African one.

The expressions you will find between these pages have shaped and been shaped by diverse people and cultures. They have given us relief, given us reason to laugh, given us ways to describe both the mundane and the profound minutes from which our lives grow. They speak of birds and honey and lakes.

Meanwhile, this cumbersome, detailed examination by Bosco (The Boys Who Would Be Cubs, 1990) raises as many questions as it answers. Myers's husband, Kerry, and his best friend, Bill Fontanille, had different versions of what went on during the bloody struggle that resulted in Janet's death. Fontanille, who readily admitted sleeping with Janet, said he stopped by the house to retrieve his baseball bat and Kerry began stabbing him, talking incoherently, and battering Janet, who was apparently unconscious. By contrast, Kerry stated that Fontanille bludgeoned Janet and shattered Kerry's arm with the bat--but that Kerry managed to stab Fontanille several times. Neither man could explain how the couple's toddler son sustained a severe head injury, resulting in coma. Bosco recounts Kerry's 911 call in its entirety; repeats police and medical reports, as well as court testimony; offers fresh statements from friends and relatives; and adds updated comments by many of the investigators, medical personnel, and attorneys involved in the subsequent six years of legal wrangling. Blood spatters placed both men near Janet during at least one of possibly three separate beatings. One series of blows apparently occurred after she expired, and Bosco notes that, technically, Janet died of coronary arrest caused by an air embolism. Moreover, the ``arbitrary air bubble'' probably didn't kill her until two hours after the initial beating: She could have been saved had either Kerry or Fontanille called for an ambulance. Though a sole ``batman'' was never established, both Kerry Myers and Fontanille were found guilty of the murder. Fontanille received 21 years for manslaughter, while Myers got life without parole for second-degree murder. Bosco captures the bizarre, frenetic nature of the case, but repetitive and extraneous material only adds to the confusion. (Sixteen b&amp;w photos--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Janet Cannon Myers, a 26-year-old suburban New Orleans housewife, had two children, a husband and a lover when she was beaten to death with a baseball bat on February 24, 1984. Bosco ( The Boys Who Would Be Cubs ) opens his first true-crime thriller with the verbatim transcript, covering more than 10 pages, of Kerry Myers's call to the sheriff's office reporting that his wife had been murdered by her unemployed lover, Bill Fontanille. Investigating officers were suspicious: Myers claimed that he had just fought with the murderer, yet his wife had been dead for hours; police found one of the couple's sons badly beaten and lying in a closet. Bosco searches everywhere for information about this case and notes everything he finds from police reports, interviews, psychic readings and even the victim's diary. The author's research can be overwhelming at times, but the story, particularly as it unfolds at the trials of the husband and lover, holds one's interest. Fontanille's first trial ended with a deadlocked jury, but six years later he and Myers were each convicted of the murder in separate trials. They are now serving sentences of 20 years and life respectively.

He was very tall, and in the shadowy, dim light he at first appeared to be dark&#x2014;and sinister. She had the uneasy feeling that he had been standing there, staring into the room in silence for a long time. Staring as she slept, making her feel oddly vulnerable.<br><br>His shoulders were broad beneath a heavy winter coat, and he seemed to stand very straight, with a great deal of confidence and assurance. She sensed that he wasn't watching her. He was watching her father.<br><br>Waiting for him to die.<br><br>Kit blinked, and awkwardly tried to rise, wanting to demand to know who he was, and what the hell he was doing. But when she blinked, he was gone. There was no man in the doorway.<br><br>Frowning, she rose and walked to the door and looked out into the hall. There was no one there, either.<br><br>She'd fallen asleep in the hospital chair at her father's side, and apparently dreamed that he was there.<br><br>"Katherine Delaney, you're losing it&#x2014;though exactly what 'it' is I'm not sure, nor am I sure you ever had it," she said aloud to herself, trying to dispel the unease that had settled over her. She looked around her father's darkened hospital room once again. It had been late afternoon when she dozed. It might well be late in the night now. Shadows were everywhere.<br><br>Kit watched the IV's clear liquid as it dripped, traveled along the length of tube, and entered into Mark Delaney's vein.<br><br>He hadn't moved for a long time, and until she had opened her eyes to see the vision in the doorway, neither had Kit. Of course, it had been longer for him. He had lain in a coma for more than a week now, and it was doubtful that he would ever awaken again. She had accepted that fact. There had been days when she had tried not to cry because she had wanted to encourage him as though he could still hear her. There had been days when she had cried buckets. Now, there was an acceptance in her heart, but she had no intention of leaving him now, not until the very end. And it didn't matter whether he knew that she was there or not.<br><br><em>She</em> knew.<br><br>A rueful half smile curved her lips. In her dozing, she had probably had strange snatches of dreams. Her friend Jennifer would say that she was having desperate illusions. Her subliminal mind was <em>inventing</em> a tall, dark, mysterious stranger for her, since it had been months now since she had done anything but work or spend time with her dad. Jennifer basically understood, but she shook her head over the fact that Kit hadn't taken so much as a few hours to go out and find a handsome hunk, a suitable dinner companion or&#x2014;for sanity's sake&#x2014;a one-night stand on her own.<br><br>"Jen, it's just not the time," she said softly, and looked down at her father. His illness had ravaged his features, but he was still handsome. His cheeks were sunken, his eyes were closed. But she would remember them, forever. Bright powder-blue, full of life, laughter and wisdom.<br><br>"Kit?"<br><br>She started as Sherry, her father's very skinny but wonderfully compassionate and competent nurse, slipped quietly into the room. Had it been Sherry she had seen in the doorway before? Had Kit, in strange, quiet dreams of drifting time, imagined the nurse to be a tall stranger in a winter coat?<br><br>"I didn't mean to startle you," Sherry said.<br><br>"No, no, it's okay."<br><br>"He showing any signs of distress?"<br><br>Kit shook her head. She knew that the doctors had told the nurses all they could do at this stage was make their patient comfortable. When he needed more morphine, he was to get it. But he hadn't shown any signs of distress. He hadn't shown any signs of life, either, other than the little blips on the screen, for days now.<br><br>"Honey, it's way, way past dinner time. You go on out for a few minutes. Stretch, walk, get yourself something to eat and some coffee."<br><br>"I don't want to leave him alone."<br><br>"I'm signed out, my paperwork is done and the night shift nurses arrived a long time ago," Sherry informed her. "I'll sit right here with him and read up on the new drug literature."<br><br>"Sherry, you've worked all day! I can't impose&#x2014;" "Get!" Sherry said firmly, settling into the chair by Mark Delaney's side.<br><br>Kit started to protest again, but Sherry had already turned on one of the lights and opened her book. "You're ruining my concentration," Sherry informed her.<br><br>"Thanks," Kit said graciously. She did need to get out of the room.<br><br>It was late, she realized as she walked down the hallways. Past regular visiting hours, though the fact that the hospital offered all private rooms kept patients' family coming in and out around the clock. No one seemed to be around at the moment. The hallways were entirely deserted as she walked toward the elevators. "Shades of <em>Halloween IIP"</em> she murmured softly as she punched the down button. She hadn't seen the slasher movie in years, but she could suddenly recall a limping Jamie Lee Curtis being chased along empty hospital corridors. The homicidal maniac coming after her relentlessly. In the movie, the night nurse couldn't help because she'd been having sex in the hot tub with another hospital employee and the murderer had boiled them both. Kit, however, sincerely doubted, that, should she need help, the hospital staff would all be parboiled in the therapy whirlpool. Sherry would be indignant and furious at such a suggestion.<br><br>Scary movie, though. Jen would probably say that it carried a subliminal message warning employees to avoid sex in the workplace.<br><br>Strangely, she was actually feeling a little nervous. Sure, people would show up if she screamed, but of course, they would think her a maniac, and have her escorted out of the hospital&#x2014;and possibly admitted into another kind of institution. She had nothing to be afraid of here, and she knew it. It was strange how the mind played tricks. Especially now, when she was so tired. However, the emptiness of the corridors still seemed a bit eerie.<br><br>The cafeteria would definitely be closed, she thought, walking along the ground floor hallway. Maybe <em>Halloween II</em> hadn't been quite so silly. She'd changed floors and hallways, and still hadn't encountered another soul.<br><br>"Kit, get a grip!" she said, then realized that she'd spoken aloud to herself several times in the last hour, and groaned.<br><br>"Coffee, I need coffee!"<br><br>She was doing it again. But she spoke aloud often in the hospital room, talking to her father. As long as the graph on his monitor was "blipping," she was going to talk to him.<br><br>The cafeteria was closed and locked, but she'd learned through experience that, oddly enough, the vending machine in the snack shop made decent coffee, even going so far as to offer a choice of Colombian, cappuccino, espresso, and French roast. Naturally, however, as she stood in front of the machine, she realized she had no change. Ah. The machine took dollar bills.<br><br>Except for <em>her</em> dollar bills, she realized with aggravation as the machine spit back her third one-dollar bill.<br><br>"Dammit! I <em>do</em> have the president facing the right way!" she informed the machine.<br><br>She dug through her bag and tried all five ones in her possession, but the coffee machine continued to spit them back. Frustrated, she swore and kicked the machine.<br><br>"May I help?"<br><br>The deep, slightly amused male voice coming from behind her startled her so badly that she jumped and spun around, her heart in her throat. She almost expected to see the maniac from <em>Halloween II</em> standing there.<br><br>But of course that murderer hadn't looked anything like the stranger before her.<br><br>This man might have stepped out of the pages of <em>GQ.</em> Jen would say that he was "devastating, to die for." He wore a business suit, expensively cut, possibly Armani or Versace, she guessed. He was tall, broad-shouldered, and wore the suit well. It was late, and he had loosened his tie; the weariness about him seemed to add to his rugged good looks. She estimated him to be somewhere between thirty and thirty-five years old, with dark-auburn, collar-length hair. His eyes were true brown, without a touch of hazel, so dark that they appeared black as coal. He was bronzed as though he spent a lot of time in the sun. Strange, Kit thought, since snowstorms were currently plaguing the north from Seattle to Maine.<br><br>She realized that she was just staring at him. And for the first time in forever, she was wondering about her own appearance. Naturally, she was a disaster. Wearing worn jeans and a Museum of Natural History<br><br>T-shirt with a large dinosaur that appeared to roar. Her hair was probably clean enough, but not brushed. And she wasn't wearing a speck of makeup, but maybe that would be all right. She was supposed to look a great deal like her mother, and Marina, she had been told, had possessed some of the finest coloring in the world, with hair so dark her father described it as the "ebony of a raven's wing" and eyes "so blue they were like the sky right when dusk began to turn to twilight."<br><br>Ah, the human mind! She wanted to explain to the stranger that she was usually halfway decent looking. Then she wondered what difference it made, he was a man visiting a relative, compassionate enough to try to help her get some coffee, and she was here...well, she was here for very serious reasons. How could she even worry about something so superfluous as looks at a time like this?<br><br>"May I help?" he repeated politely.<br><br>Embarrassed, she felt herself flushing. She wasn't usually dumbstruck at the sight of a man, not even one as imposing as this.<br><br>"I'm so sorry. You startled me. The place is so quiet. Like a morgue." <em>Bad choice of words.</em> "If you have any more luck with machinery than I do, I'd be grateful for any form of a cup of coffee."<br><br>He grinned, stepping by her. "It <em>is</em> quiet here tonight," he said. "Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."<br><br>"I wasn't scared."<br><br>He looked at her, arching a brow slightly. He clearly didn't believe her. "Good," he said, reaching into his jacket and pulling out a leather wallet. His bills were clean and crisp and hadn't been wadded into a messy purse like her crumpled ones. The machine took his dollar instantly. Kit resented the machine and wondered if an inanimate object could have feminine traits and respond to a man.<br><br>"What would you like?" he asked her.<br><br>"What would I like?"<br><br>"Coffee&#x2014;espresso?"<br><br>"Oh, I'm not just going to get coffee, but the choice the machine promises. French roast, thank you," she said, flushing again as he pressed the right button. Coffee poured into a foam cup. He reached for it, handed it to her, then put another bill into the machine and hit the same button again. She was still just standing there, staring at him.<br><br>"I&#x2014;thank you. Oh! How rude of me, I'm sorry. Here's one of my reject bills&#x2014;" she began, offering him a dollar.<br><br>He shook his head. "It's all right. I needed coffee myself."<br><br>"Thanks so much, but I can't let you do that&#x2014;" "It was a dollar. Just a dollar. And I got change back, too." He fingered the coin return, and produced several quarters. "See?"<br><br>"But really&#x2014;"<br><br>"Are you a raging feminist?" he inquired, a dark brow arched, his smile amused.<br><br>"No!" she exclaimed. "Well, of course, I believe in equal rights and equal pay and&#x2014;"<br><br>She broke off, because he was subtly smiling at her. Not in a mean way. She didn't need to explain herself.<br><br>"I'm not a raging feminist," she said evenly. "Thank you for the coffee." She could be gracious, and judging by the cut of his clothing, he could certainly afford to squander a few quarters, even on a stranger. What did he do for a living? she wondered. Attorney, she decided. He'd be wicked in court.<br><br>"My name is David Moore," he said, offering her his hand.<br><br>She smiled, accepting it. "Kit&#x2014;Katherine, Mr. Moore, and thank you very much for the coffee."<br><br>He inclined his head slightly. "You're staring at me strangely, you know."<br><br>"Am I? Sorry. I'm tired I guess."<br><br>"You were thinking something," he prodded.<br><br>She laughed then. "Yes, I was. I was thinking that you look like you should be an attorney."<br><br>"Prosecution or defense?"<br><br>"Prosecution&#x2014;or defense, either. I admit, in my mind's eye, I saw you making mincemeat of a witness on the stand. Or...telling a jury with passionate indignation that they can't possibly convict a man for such a horrendous crime on circumstantial evidence."<br><br>"Hmm, interesting. Do I look like an ogre?"<br><br>"Fierce. Intense&#x2014;or possibly cool as a cucumber. Are you an attorney?"<br><br>"I keep up my credentials in the state of Florida, but I haven't practiced for a while."<br><br>"Ah, but you were an attorney!"<br><br>"Yep, I worked for the district attorney for several years. And I was with a firm in private practice as well."<br><br>"But no more?"<br><br>"No more." He didn't explain further. Looking at his suit, she wondered if he'd won a lottery. Florida. That explained the tan. It didn't explain what he was doing in frigid Chicago. "And you?" he asked. "Pardon?"<br><br>"What do you do?"<br><br>"Oh. I do a syndicated comic strip." "Great. Have I read you?"<br><br>"Maybe. I'm just beginning to get picked up. I do a little strip called <em>Annie's Day.</em> Pitfalls of day-to-day life, dating in the twenty-first century and the like."<br><br>"Ah. Nice."<br><br>"Have you seen it?"<br><br>"Yes, I think I have."<br><br>"You're just being polite." "I'm seldom just polite."<br><br>She arched a brow, sipping her coffee, shaking her head. "I can't believe that. You came to my aid with your dollar bills. Oh, and listen, I'm sorry to have kept you. I imagine you're here to visit someone?"<br><br>"An old friend, a man I haven't seen in years. In fact, I believe I've made the trip for nothing, so it was delightful to talk with you."<br><br>"Your friend has passed away?"<br><br>"I just asked about him at the information booth. They said that if I waited, a nurse would be free to speak with me. I may not even get to see my friend. He's in a coma."<br><br>Suspicion triggered quickly in Kit's mind. "What's his name?" she asked thickly.<br><br>"Delaney. Mark Delaney."<br><br>"My father," Kit said softly.<br><br>He arched a brow very high, and seemed to reassess her. Carefully. He smiled. "I should have known. Kit. Katherine. Katherine Delaney. You didn't say that."<br><br>She kept staring at him, confused. "How could you have known? Or&#x2014;should I know you? You're an old friend of my <em>father''s?"</em><br><br>He nodded, smiling ruefully. "A voice from the past, actually." He hesitated. "And I should have known you because you're the spitting image of your mother. I'm not so sure you'd remember me, but, yes, you did know me. You were very young at the time, but once, you lived at a huge estate called Bougainvillea. On the water. Your mother died when you were just six&#x2014;"<br><br>"She drowned."<br><br>He nodded. "Your father was devastated when she passed away. He left Miami&#x2014;and never returned."<br><br>"I have a very vague memory of Florida," Kit said, intrigued. "My father didn't want to remember a lot. We didn't talk about it. I do remember a big beach area, ponds, long grass, lots of flowers, a big old house with arches and gables...partially constructed out of coral rock. I had a wonderful room with a tiled balcony. And I remember a vague assortment of people there&#x2014;but forgive me, how rude, I don't remember you."<br><br></p><h2>Disappearance Diary</h2><p>In 1989 Hideo Azuma left his family and work and tried (unsuccessfully) to hang himself using the slope of a mountain.

She was Ernest Hemingway&#39;s first wife and she existed chiefly by proxy -- contentedly submissive to both his tastes (whether skiing or bullfighting) and work which she placed above her own demands or those of their child (she had him when he was off on a job). A shy girl, encouraged to enjoy ill health by her family, she turned out to have far more stamina than anyone suspected, following Ernest &#34;&#34;into the fullness of an extraordinarily vital world&#34;&#34; -- Paris (Pound, Stein, the Fitzgeralds, et al), back to Canada, and Paris again where she gave him up -- equally acceptantly -- to Pauline.

But as he begins conducting his own investigation into the case, Charley comes to believe that Miles his client has been framed. And that the real killer is using Dane's own bizarre imagination against him.<br><br>But if that's true, why doesn't Dane speak up?<br><br>Charley thinks he knows why. Dane has something to hide. Something from his past. Something shameful.<br><br>Charley understands shame. A recovering alcoholic with a string of wrecked marriages behind him, he has his own dark past.

And reveal the stunning truth.<br></p><p>William Coughlin's series character Charley Sloan gets a second lease on life in this new thriller that carries the small-town Michigan lawyer into murder and mayhem; vintage heroes never die, even if their creators do, and Walter Sorrells, a talented writer whose mysteries plow much of the same ground, carries on Coughlin's series with a nifty setup--a bestselling crime writer fallen on hard times who's accused of murdering his wife in a plot taken from one of his own books. Miles Dane may get away with murder unless Charley can prove he's been set up by the man who may--or may not--be his long-lost son. This is a solid legal thriller that will delight the late Coughlin's fans who've wondered what happened to Charley and what's still happening in picturesque Pickeral Point.

Throughout, Evans and Giroux champion the significance of public education, social movements and ideas that rebel against the status quo in order render violence intolerable.</p><p>"<i>Disposable Futures</i> poses, and answers, the pressing question of our times: How is it that in this post-Fascist, post-Cold War era of peace and prosperity we are saddled with more war, violence, inequality and poverty than ever? The neoliberal era, Evans and Giroux brilliantly reveal, is defined by violence, by drone strikes, 'smart' bombs, militarized police, Black lives taken, prison expansion, corporatized education, surveillance, the raw violence of racism, patriarchy, starvation and want. The authors show how the neoliberal regime normalizes violence, renders its victims disposable, commodifies the spectacle of relentless violence and sells it to us as entertainment, and tries to contain cultures of resistance.

Kelley, author of <i>Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination</i></p><p>"<i>Disposable Futures</i> confronts a key conundrum of our times: How is it that, given the capacity and abundance of resources to address the critical needs of all, so many are having their futures radically discounted while the privileged few dramatically increase their wealth and power? Brad Evans and Henry Giroux have written a trenchant analysis of the logic of late capitalism that has rendered it normal to dispose of any who do not service the powerful.

Anyone concerned with trying to comprehend these driving dynamics of our time would be well served by taking up this compelling book."--David Theo Goldberg, author of <i>The Threat of Race: Reflections on Racial Neoliberalism</i></p><p>"<i>Disposable Futures</i> is an utterly spellbinding analysis of violence in the later 20th and early 21st centuries. It strikes me as a new breed of street-smart intellectualism moving through broad ranging theoretical influences of Adorno, Arendt, Bauman, Deleuze, Foucault, Zizek, Marcuse, and Reich. I especially appreciated a number of things, including: the discussion of representation and how it functions within a broader logics of power; the descriptions and analyses of violence mediating the social field and fracturing it through paralyzing fear and anxiety; the colonization of bodies and pleasures; and the nuanced discussion of how state violence, surveillance, and disposability connect.

Having recently emerged from obscurity, Black Hawk's drawing book now stands as the most complete visual record extant of Lakota art of the early reservation period (1875-95). It is published here in full, for the first time, with fine quality color plates of each drawing. Detailed commentary accompanies the drawings, providing insight into Lakota religion, art, and culture in the nineteenth century. Some of Black Hawk's illustrations are the only known drawings of ceremonies described in ethnographic works such as <i>Black Elk Speaks</i>, the famous account of visions experienced by Lakota holy man Black Elk. The ceremonies depicted in Black Hawk's drawings include the Sun Dance, buffalo transformation ceremonies, and ceremonies honoring the sacred pipe. He also recorded scenes of Lakota encounters with the Crow, of buffalo hunting, and of wildlife. An invaluable contribution to our knowledge of Native American history and art, Black Hawk's drawing book is a window unto a complex and eloquent world. 76 color illustrations, 20 b/w illustrations.</p><p><b>Janet Catherine Berlo</b> is an American art historian and academic, noted for her publications and research into the visual arts heritage of Native American and pre-Columbian cultures.In the early 1880s, Black Hawk, a Lakota medicine man living on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation in South Dakota, was commissioned to create 76 drawings by a local trader. Paid 50 cents per image, Black Hawk created a uniquely rich series capturing his dreams, Lakota religious rituals and scenes of hunting and animal life. The drawings, now in the collection of the Fenimore Art Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y., form the basis of this book, and they are astonishing. Black Hawk's Dream or Vision of himself changed to a destroyer is uncannily like a Hieronymous Bosch nightmare, while his detailed views of Animal medicine society rituals, in which participants dressed in skins of various beasts, boast both precision and intense spirituality. Perhaps most amazing of all are his drawings of animals, especially bats and bears, which unite a naturalist's observation with a gripping narrative suggestiveness. Use of color, although clearly limited to the choice of pencils the impoverished artist owned, is subtle and gratifying. All 76 drawings are beautifully reproduced here in full color and are attractively and accessibly laid out, along with 16 b&amp;w details. A University of Rochester professor of gender and women's studies and art history, Berlo (Plains Indian Drawings 1865-1935) provides expert historical and cultural context for the images. Black Hawk is certainly one of 19th-century America's great artists; this is a must-have item for libraries and collectors with even the slightest interest in American art and history, and stores will find that despite the price, browsers will not want to part with it.

Do we discover them, as Plato supposed and many others have believed since, or do we construct them? Does mathematics constitute a universal language that in principle would permit human beings to communicate with extraterrestrial civilizations elsewhere in the universe, or is it merely an earthly language that owes its accidental existence to the peculiar evolution of neuronal networks in our brains? Does the physical world actually obey mathematical laws, or does it seem to conform to them simply because physicists have increasingly been able to make mathematical sense of it? Jean-Pierre Changeux, an internationally renowned neurobiologist, and Alain Connes, one of the most eminent living mathematicians, find themselves deeply divided by these questions.</p><br><p> The problematic status of mathematical objects leads Changeux and Connes to the organization and function of the brain, the ways in which its embryonic and post-natal development influences the unfolding of mathematical reasoning and other kinds of thinking, and whether human intelligence can be simulated, modeled,--or actually reproduced-- by mechanical means. The two men go on to pose ethical questions, inquiring into the natural foundations of morality and the possibility that it may have a neural basis underlying its social manifestations. This vivid record of profound disagreement and, at the same time, sincere search for mutual understanding, follows in the tradition of Poincar�, Hadamard, and von Neumann in probing the limits of human experience and intellectual possibility. Why order should exist in the world at all, and why it should be comprehensible to human beings, is the question that lies at the heart of these remarkable dialogues.</p></p><p><p>"This wonderfully eloquent and playful colloquy of two brilliant minds gives new life to the old notion of Dialogue, a sadly forgotten form now....

Like all journeys, it is stimulating, widens one's horizons, and leaves one wishing one could stay longer. The reader is treated to an inside look at the workings of two great minds, and is privileged to enjoy their reflections on an unusually wide range of topics.

Focusing on Puritanism as a cultural and political phenomenon as well as a religious movement, Foster addresses parallel developments on both sides of the Atlantic and firmly embeds New England Puritanism within its English context. He provides not only an elaborate critque of current interpretations of Puritan ideology but also an original and insightful portrayal of its dynamism.<br><br>According to Foster, Puritanism represented a loose and incomplete alliance of progressive Protestants, lay and clerical, aristocratic and humble, who never decided whether they were the vanguard or the remnant. Indeed, in Foster's analysis, changes in New England Puritanism after the first decades of settlement did not indicate secularization and decline but instead were part of a pattern of change, conflict, and accomodation that had begun in England. He views the Puritans' own claims of declension as partisan propositions in an internal controversy as old as the Puritan movement itself. The result of these stresses and adaptations, he argues, was continued vitality in American Puritanism during the second half of the seventeenth century.<br><br>Foster draws insights from a broad range of souces in England and America, including sermons, diaries, spiritual autobiographies, and colony, town, and court records. Moreover, his presentation of the history of the English and American Puritan movements in tandem brings out the fatal flaws of the former as well as the modest but essential strengths of the latter.<br><br></p><p>"Foster's book contains a wealth of detail and insight, and the author demonstrates an impressive familiarity with primary sources and scholarly literature for both English and American Puritanism. . . .

Midwinter.<br><br>Early in January 2006 a lone wolf crosses the unmarked border and enters Sweden from Vauldalen in Norway. A man on a snowmobile thinks he might have glimpsed it just outside Fj�lln�s, but the wolf vanishes into the trees heading east before he is able to pinpoint it. In the remote Norwegian �sterdalarna Mountains it had discovered a lump of frozen moose carcass, with remnants of meat still clinging to the bones. But that was more than two days ago. It is beginning to feel the pain of hunger and is desperately searching for food.<br><br>The wolf is a young male that has set out to find a territory of his own. He continues his way eastward. At N�vjarna, north of Linsell, he finds another moose carcass. For a whole day he stays and eats his fill before resuming his trek east. When he comes to K�rb�le he trots over the frozen Ljusnan and then follows the river along its winding route toward the sea. One moonless night he lopes silently over the bridge at J�rvs�, then heads into the vast forests that stretch to the coast.<br><br>In the early morning of January 13 the wolf reaches Hesj�vallen, a tiny village south of Hansesj�n Lake in H�lsingland. He pauses and sniffs the air. He detects the smell of blood. He looks around. There are people living in the houses but no smoke rising from the chimneys. His sharp ears can&#x2019;t detect the slightest sound.<br><br>But the wolf is in no doubt about the blood. He skulks at the edge of the forest, nose in the air. Then he moves forward, silently, through the snow. The smell comes from one of the houses at the far end of the hamlet. He is vigilant now&#x2014;with humans around it&#x2019;s essential to be both careful and patient. He pauses again. The smell originates from the back of the house. He waits. Then eventually starts moving once more. When he gets there he finds another carcass. He drags his large meal back to the trees. He has not been discovered, not even the village dogs have stirred. The silence is total this freezing cold morning.<br><br>The wolf starts eating when he comes to the edge of the trees. It is easy, as the flesh has not yet frozen. He is very hungry now. Having pulled off a leather shoe, he starts gnawing away at an ankle.<br><br>It snowed during the night but stopped before dawn. As the wolf eats his fill, snowflakes once again start dancing down toward the frozen ground.<br><br>2<br><br>When Karsten H�glin woke up he remembered dreaming about a photograph. He lay motionless in bed and felt the image returning slowly, as if the negative of his dream were sending a copy into his conscious mind. He recognized the picture. It was black and white and depicted a man sitting on an old iron bed, with a hunting rifle hanging on the wall and a chamber pot at his feet. When he saw it for the first time, he had been gripped by the old man&#x2019;s wistful smile. There was something timorous and evasive about him. Much later Karsten had discovered the background. A few years earlier the man had accidentally shot and killed his only son while hunting seabirds. From then on the rifle had never come down from the wall, and the man had become a hermit.<br><br>H�glin thought that of all the thousands of photographs and negatives he had seen, this was the one he would never forget. He wished he had taken it himself.<br><br>The clock on his bedside table read half past seven. H�glin usually woke up very early, but he had slept badly that night, the bed and its mattress were uncomfortable. He made up his mind to complain about them when he checked out of the hotel.<br><br>It was the ninth and final day of his journey. It had been made possible by a scholarship enabling him to study deserted villages and other small settlements that were being depopulated. He had come as far as Hudiksvall and had one hamlet left to photograph. He had chosen this particular one because an old man who lived there had read about his project and sent him a letter. H�glin had been impressed by the letter and decided that this was the place for him to conclude his study.<br><br>He got up and opened the curtains. It had snowed during the night and was still gray, the sun not yet risen. A bundled-up woman was cycling past in the street below. Karsten considered her and wondered how cold it was. Negative five degrees Celsius, possibly negative seven.<br><br>He dressed and took the slow-moving elevator down to reception. He had parked his car in the enclosed courtyard behind the hotel. It was safe there. Even so, he had taken all his photographic equipment up to his room, as was his practice. His worst nightmare was to come to his car one day and find that all his cameras had vanished.<br><br>The receptionist was a young girl, barely out of her teens. He noticed that her makeup was slapdash and gave up on the idea of complaining about the bed. After all, he had no intention of ever returning to the hotel.<br><br>In the breakfast room a few guests were absorbed in their morning papers. For a fleeting moment he was tempted to get a camera and take a shot. It gave him the feeling that Sweden had always been exactly like this. Silent people, poring over their newspapers with a cup of coffee, absorbed in their own thoughts, their own fates.<br><br>But he resisted the temptation, served himself coffee, buttered two slices of bread, and tucked into a soft-boiled egg. Without a newspaper, he ate quickly. He hated being at a meal on his own without anything to read.<br><br>It was colder than he expected when he emerged from the hotel. He stood on tiptoe to read the thermometer in the reception window. Negative eleven degrees. And falling, he suspected. This winter has been far too warm. Here comes the cold spell we&#x2019;ve been expecting. He put his cases on the backseat, started the engine, and began scraping ice off the windshield. There was a map on the passenger seat. The previous day, after taking pictures of a village not far from Lake Hassela, he had worked out how to get to his final port of call: take the main road southward, turn off toward S�rforsa near Iggesund, then follow either the east or the west shore of the lake called Storsj�n in some parts and L�ngsj�n in others. The guy at the gas station on the way into Hudiksvall had warned him that the east road was bad, but he decided to take it anyway. It would be quicker. And the light was so lovely this winter morning. He could already envisage the smoke rising straight up to the sky from the chimneys.<br><br>It took him forty minutes to get there. By then he had already made a wrong turn, a road leading southward to N�cksj�.<br><br>Hesj�vallen was situated in a little valley by a lake whose name he couldn&#x2019;t recall. Hesj�n, maybe? The dense forests extended all the way to the hamlet, on both sides of the narrow road leading up toward H�rjedalen.<br><br>Karsten stopped at the edge of the tiny village and got out of the car. There were breaks in the clouds now. The light would become more difficult to capture, perhaps not so expressive. He looked around. Everything was very still. The houses gave the impression of having been there since time immemorial. In the distance he could hear the faint noise of traffic on the main road.<br><br>He suddenly felt uneasy. He held his breath, as he always did when confronted with something he didn&#x2019;t really understand.<br><br>Then it dawned on him&#x2014;the chimneys, they were cold. There was no sign of smoke, which would have been an effective feature of the photographs he hoped to take. His gaze moved slowly from house to house. Somebody&#x2019;s cleared the snow already, he thought. But not lit a single fire? He remembered the letter he&#x2019;d received from the man who had told him about the village. He had referred to the chimneys and how the houses seemed, in a childish sort of way, to be sending smoke signals to one another.<br><br>He sighed. People don&#x2019;t write the truth, but what they think you want to read. Now should I take pictures with cold chimneys or abandon the whole business? Nobody was forcing him to take photographs of Hesj�vallen and its inhabitants. He already had plenty of pictures of the Sweden that was fading away: the derelict farms, the remote villages whose only hope of survival was that Danes and Germans would buy up the houses and turn them into summer cottages. He decided to leave and returned to his car. But he didn&#x2019;t start the engine. He had come this far; the least he could do was to try to create some portrait of the local inhabitants&#x2014;he wanted faces. As the years passed, Karsten H�glin had become increasingly fascinated by elderly people. He wanted to compile an album: pictures that would describe the beauty found only in the faces of very old women, their lives and hardships etched into their skin like the sediment in a cliff wall.<br><br>He got out of his car again, pulled his fur hat down over his ears, picked out a Leica M6 he&#x2019;d been using for the past ten years, and made for the nearest of the group of houses. There were ten in all, most of them timber and painted red, some with added stoops. He could see only one modern house. If it could still be called modern, that is&#x2014;a 1950s detached house. When he came to the gate, he paused and raised his camera. The nameplate indicated that the Andr�n family lived there. He took a few shots, varying the aperture setting and exposure time, trying out several angles, though it was clear that there wasn&#x2019;t enough light yet and he would get only an indistinct blur. But you never know. Photographers sometimes expose unexpected secrets.<br><br>H�glin was intuitive with his work. Not that he didn&#x2019;t bother to measure light levels when required, but sometimes he&#x2019;d pull off surprising results without paying attention to carefully calculated exposure times. Improvisation went with the territory.<br><br>The gate was stiff. He had to push hard in order to open it. There were no footprints in the newly fallen...</p><h2>101 Things To Do With a BBQ</h2><p><p>Backyard barbeque guru Steve Tillet has collected 101 fantastic recipes for barbeque of all varieties&#x2014;from appetizers to desserts to vegetarian solutions&#x2014;proving that the grill is the best and easiest summertime cooking option.</p> <p>Get outta the kitchen with amazingly simple recipes like Poppin' BBQ Popcorn, Blue Cheese Stuffed Mushrooms, Stuffed Tomatoes on the Grill, Grilled Onion Bloom, Seafood Pesto Pizza, Doc's Dry-Rub T-Bone Steak, Roberto's South American Lime Ribs, Andie's Angelic BBQ Burgers, Scott's Tantalizing Dry Rub Chicken, Grant's Monday Night Special Buffalo Wings, Parmesan Grilled Halibut, and even desserts like Chocolate Banana Bang-a-rang.
